International Research Laboratory of Green Buildings and Built Environments (Ministry of Education) Chongqing University Chongqing 400045 China Vertical air temperature differences (VTDs) can have important influences on thermal comfort and the evaluation of air distributions. The air distributions might create either positive or negative VTDs. However, no research has clearly revealed the effect of different directions of VTDs on human comfort. To create environments with positive and negative VTDs in this study, the air temperature of half of the body was maintained at an air temperature of 25 °C, whereas the other half of the body (the upper or lower body part, respectively) was exposed to air temperatures of 22 °C, 25 °C, 28 °C, and 31 °C, respectively. That is two series of experiments with the same VTD value but different directions were compared, based on 16 subjects seated in a climatic box in a climate chamber. The thermal sensations, sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms, and physiological responses of occupants were studied. The results showed that subjects were more sensitive to the VTD at the upper body part in warm environments with respect to thermal sensations, perceived air quality, and sweat intensity. The analysis indicated that there were more discomfort and heat stress for positive VTDs than negative VTDs. Thus, the criterion for acceptable negative VTDs should be different with the positive VTDs incorporated in current standards. Overall, the directions of the VTDs were suggested to be considered for evaluating the thermally stratified air distributions based on both of thermal comfort and energy efficiency in buildings.

Indoor thermal environments with vertical air temperature differences (VTDs 1 1 VTD is defined as the difference from the neutral temperature (which is 25 °C) of the other half of the body in this study. The value of VTD equals to the non-neutral air temperature minus 25 °C. ) exist universally in buildings, as they are vital for thermal comfort of occupants (Eriksson and Domier, 1975; Olesen et al., 1979; Tanaka et al., 1986). Understanding human responses to thermal environments with different VTDs is important for enhancing thermal satisfaction of users and optimizing energy consumption of air distribution systems (Cheng et al., 2022). With the development of technology and concerns regarding the global energy crisis, many advanced air distributions (Yang et al., 2019) with different VTD directions have been applied in buildings. In displacement ventilation systems, supply air is delivered from a near-floor or floor level where the air temperature at the head level is higher than that at the feet level (i.e., positive VTDs) (Ahn et al., 2017; Nielsen et al., 2002; Schiavon et al., 2016a). However, in some other air distribution methods, e.g., personal air supply systems (Melikov et al., 2013) and stratum ventilation (Lin et al., 2009), the cool air is delivered directly to the head levels of occupants, creating lower air temperatures at the head level than that at the feet level (i.e., negative VTDs). Studies have shown that these systems have some advantages in regards to thermal comfort (Deng et al., 2017) and energy consumption (Chen et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2015, 2017) under different summer conditions. However, there is no standard for considering the differences from different directions of VTDs while evaluating thermal comfort in the environments created by these types of advanced air distribution methods. Current international standards (ISO, 2005) recommend a VTD between the head and ankle level within 3–4 °C. However, this has also been challenged by many studies in various environments with VTDs. Palonen et al., 1991, 1992, Wyon et al. (Wyon and Sandberg, 1996) and Yu et al. (Cheong et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007) found that the thermal comfort of subjects was unaffected by temperature gradients up to 5 °C/m. Liu et al. (2017b) and Schiavon et al. (2016b) determined that a VTD up to 6 – 8 °C had an insignificant effect on the thermal comfort of subjects in displacement ventilation systems. A recent study (Möhlenkamp et al., 2019) also revealed that an acceptable VTD could reach up to 8 °C in an overall thermally neutral environment. Although not all of the boundary conditions of these experiments are known, within the acceptable range of VTDs in these studies, the air temperatures were less varied at the upper body part (i.e., 23–28 °C), and more varied at the lower body part (i.e., 16–30 °C). One possible reason for the different conclusions in the above studies could be that thermal comfort was not only affected by VTD, but by which body parts were exposed to the non-neutral environment (i.e., the directions of the VTD). Researches (Hagino and Hara, 1992; Jin, 2012; Park et al., 2011; Zhang and Zhao, 2007) have revealed that the local thermal sensations at different body parts might also have different effects on the overall thermal sensation votes (TSVs) in uniform thermal environments; nevertheless, these effects have not been fully studied in a thermal environment with VTD. A study has shown that a VTD at upper body parts might affect the thermal sensation more strongly than one at lower body parts (Bohgaki et al., 1990). One reason is that the air temperature at the head level might strongly affect the thermal comfort of the breathing system (Fang et al., 1998, 2004; Toftum et al., 1998; Wu et al., 2017). This made that the thermal comfort and physiological responses in thermal environments with different directions of VTD more varied and complicated. Thus, the thermal dissatisfaction might be different when lower or upper body parts were exposed to environments with VTDs. A previous study (Tanaka et al., 1986) used a climatic box to maintain the lower body at constant 25 °C while the air temperatures at upper body were varied from 15 to 35 °C, which found that the thermal sensation vote of whole body was close to that of upper body. In the following studies, the upper body was maintained at a constant temperature while the air temperatures at lower body were varied between 16 and 25 °C with 16 gender-balanced young Japanese (Hashiguchi et al., 2010) or with 16 different age Japanese (Hashiguchi et al., 2011), and 14–50 °C with 8 young Japanese (Enomoto et al., 2009), respectively. Significant age and gender differences of thermal comfort were found in the VTD environments. But, the Tochihara's work was the sole research to study the vertical temperature differences by putting human subjects in the climatic box, which is worthy to be further studied with more indexes using different subjects and conditions to compare the effect of different directions of VTDs. In this study, the indexes including thermal sensation, sick building syndrome, and physiological responses of occupants were investigated. According to the thermal comfort model, e.g. the commonly used PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) index (Fanger, 1970) and some others (Fang et al., 2019), thermal sensation was mainly affected by six factors including air temperature, mean radiation temperature (Wu et al., 2021b), humidity (Kong et al., 2019), wind speed/draught (Wu et al., 2021c), metabolic rate (Zhang et al., 2020b), and clothing insulation (Liu et al., 2018). However, the effect of VTD was not addressed. Physiological responses of human body were the basic for thermal perception (Li et al., 2019; Son and Chun, 2018). The physiological responses, such as heart rate (Wu et al., 2020a), blood pressure (Gilani et al., 2016), and skin temperature (Wu et al., 2020b) were believed to be associated with the mechanism of human thermal perceptions. The sick building syndrome symptoms is first revealed by World Health Organization Committee in 1980s to describe the acute health and comfort effects linked indoor environments, but no specific illness or cause can be identified (EPA, 1991). Many factors such as indoor air quality, thermal environments or stress could be the reasons (Lu et al., 2016). Thus, the effect of VTD on SBS was also investigated in this study. This study was designed to investigate the effects of the directions of VTDs on the thermal comfort and physiological responses of occupants. A climate chamber study was conducted with upper or lower body parts exposed to thermal environments with different VTDs. The results from different directions of VTDs were compared and analyzed. The findings of this study can be helpful for further understanding thermal comfort in non-uniform thermal environments. 2 Methods The experiments with human subjects in the climate chamber was used as the method in this study, which was proved to be a validated method by many scholars in thermal comfort studies (van Hoof, 2008; Zhu et al., 2016; Melikov et al., 2013; de Dear et al., 2013; Fanger, 1970; Liu et al., 2011). 2.1 Experimental platform and equipment Fig. 1 shows the climate chambers at Chongqing University, in which the experiments were performed. The dimensions of climate chamber 1 (which the subjects stayed in) were 4.0 m × 3.0 m × 2.7 m. The internal environments of climate chambers 1 and 2 were well insulated from the external environment by a thick thermal insulation material (100 mm). Climate chamber 2 was connected to a climatic box located in climate chamber 1 using three adiabatic ducts, i.e., one inlet and two outlets. The climatic box was covered with two layers of thermal insulation cotton (3 mm). An air blower was used to supply air from climate chamber 2 to the inlet of the box. The thermal conditions in the climatic box were monitored using air temperature sensors inside it. The preparation room was also air-conditioned, so that subjects could maintain thermal neutrality before the experiments. Climate chamber 1 used perforated ceiling panels and side wall panels to supply and exhaust air, respectively. A combination of a split air conditioner and perforated ceiling panels was used for cooling in climate chamber 2. The control accuracy of room air temperature is ±0.30 °C in the range of -5 – 40 °C. The control accuracy of relative humidity (RH) is ±5% in the range of 10–90%. The indoor air velocity could be adjusted in the range of 0.1–1.6 m/s, with an accuracy of the maximum of 0.1 m/s or ±20% of the value. In this study, the indoor air velocity was controlled to be at the minimum in the climate chamber. The physical parameters in the climate chamber were measured using the thermal environment monitoring station (LSI, Italy, http://www.lsi-lastem.it/en/products). The measurement sensors including air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, and black-bulb temperature at the station was approximately 1.1 m above the floor. The concentration of CO2 in the climate chambers was also detected using the GE Telaire-7001. The measurement ranges and accuracies of these instruments are summarized in Table S1. During the experiments, all the environmental data were monitored and recorded. The high accuracy temperature sensors (thermocouples, ±0.15 °C) were used to measure the local skin temperatures (LSTs) at 10 points (ISO, 2007; Liu et al., 2011), including the head, chest, back, upper arm, forearm, hand, abdomen, calf, thigh, and foot, as shown in Fig. 2 . The records of LSTs were stored in data loggers (HOBO, UX120-006M). A ten-point formula representing the weight factors for each body part was used to calculate the mean skin temperature (Liu et al., 2011). Besides the skin temperature, the heart rate and blood pressure were also measured using heart rate telemeter (Polar RS400) and electronic sphygmomanometers (HEM-6021), respectively. The applications of these instruments strictly followed the instructions of products. The heart rates and LSTs were recorded continuously every 15 s. The blood pressure was measured manually three times at each questionnaire survey time. Before the measurements, all of the instruments were calibrated. 2.2 Experiment conditions and procedure During the experiments, the body area of subject was divided into two parts each with a weight factor of approximately 0.5, based on using the approximate ratio of the local surface area in the different body parts to total body surface area (ISO, 2007; Liu et al., 2011). The upper body included head (0.06), chest (0.12), back (0.12), upper arms (0.08), forearms (0.06), and hands (0.05). The lower body included abdomen and buttocks (0.12), calves (0.13), thighs (0.19), and feet (0.07). The experiments were conducted during a hot summer period (Liu et al., 2017a), with an average outdoor air temperature of approximately 35 °C. An air temperature of 25 °C was used as a reference uniform neutral environment (Yang et al., 2015). In all non-uniform conditions, half of the body parts were maintained at the reference environment of 25 °C, whereas the other half of the body parts were exposed to non-neutral thermal conditions with different air temperatures. In this study, Td was defined as the value of a VTD, that is, the air temperature at the non-neutral parts minus the thermally neutral temperature of 25 °C. Td, upper denoted the value of air temperature at the upper body minus 25 °C, and Td, lower represented the value of air temperature at the lower body minus 25 °C. The non-neutral air temperatures of 22 (Td = −3 °C) and 28 °C (Td = 3 °C) were studied because a VTD of 3 °C was recommended as the acceptable limit for a Level B thermal environment in the current international standard (ISO, 2005). An air temperature of 31 °C (Td = 6 °C) was also studied as this study focused on warm environments in summer (the potential to maintain high air temperatures at indoor local zones for the purpose of energy saving). In total, seven thermal conditions were studied: 31/25 °C, 28/25 °C, 22/25 °C, 25/31 °C, 25/28 °C, 25/22 °C and 25 °C. Taking 31/25 °C as an example, it denotes that the subjects were exposed to a thermal environment at 31 °C for the upper body and at 25 °C for the lower body (separated by the waist at a height of 0.7 m above the floor when seated). As shown in Figs. 1 and 3 , the upper bodies of the subjects were exposed to climate chamber 1, and the lower bodies were placed into a climatic box with a height of approximately 0.7 m, in which the air temperature was controlled by the climate chamber 2 with an air duct at two sides of the box. The air temperature in the box was controlled according to the mean value of four sensors (±0.15 °C) at a height of 0.4 m inside the box, as shown in Fig. 3. The air temperature difference among these points was controlled to be less than 0.5 °C. This study focused on the effect of the vertical air temperature difference, so the air velocity was reduced as low as possible. The air velocity in the box was less than 0.2 m/s during the experiments, and there was no air movement (<0.1 m/s by readings of sensor) at the upper body. The relative humidity was designed to be about 60% (Liu et al., 2017a). All the sixteen subjects attended the seven thermal conditions. Two subjects participated at one time, and each session with a fixed thermal condition lasted for 90 min. The assignment order of an experimental test was random for each subject. All of the subjects were reminded to avoid drinking alcohol, taking strenuous exercise or staying up lately for the day before experiment date. Before entering the climate chamber, the physiological devices were attached to the subjects in the preparation room. Then they were also seated for 30 min at a neutral condition of 25 °C in the preparation room to stabilize the devices and eliminate the previous thermal effect. During the experimental period, the subjects were required to wear uniform clothing, including a short-sleeved T-shirt, long trousers, and socks. The insulation of this ensemble is about 0.5 clo (1 clo = 0.155 m2 K/W) according to American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 55 (ASHRAE, 2020). After entering the climate chamber, they will fill in a questionnaire describing their subjective responses at 15-min intervals for 1 h. The total number of questionnaires was 560, but only 336 questionnaires at the last half hour were used for the analysis in the stable conditions. The study was carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) (WMA, 2013) for experiments involving human subjects. All experiment protocols were approved by the university's ethics committee. 2.3 Subjects As being introduced by Lan and Lian (2010), a priori power analysis using G*Power 3.1 (Faul et al., 2007, 2009) was used to calculate the minimum sample size for this study. The sample size was determined by three indexes: the α error (i.e., significance level P), power level (1-β error), and effect size (d). According to the previous study (Cohen, 1988), the values of α and (1-β) were preset at 0.05 and 0.8, respectively. The t-test (also called Student's t-test) is used to compare the means between two groups, whereas ANOVA (F test) is used to compare the means among three or more groups (Mishra et al., 2019). In this study, all significant tests were conducted between two different conditions using the same subjects. Thus, the paired samples t-test, which typically occur when two measurements are taken for the same group (Agresti, 2002), was used. For the t-test under “means: Difference between two dependent means (matched pairs)” in G*Power 3.1 software, the minimum total sample size was 12, with a assumed large (d = 0.8) effect size (Lan and Lian, 2010). Therefore, for conservative consideration, sixteen college students with a sample size higher than 12 were recruited. Before the experiments, the heights and weights of subjects were measured using a height and weight scale (SUHONG). Their body fat rates were measured using a body fat meter (TANITA BC-601) with scale base of 0.1% in the range of 5–75%. Their personal information was recorded via interviews. Table 1 summarizes the basic information of the subjects. 2.4 Questionnaire A seven-point scale (ASHRAE, 2020) was used to evaluate the TSV and air freshness vote (AFV). The TSV was assessed as follows: −3 cold, −2 cool, −1 slightly cool, 0 neutral, +1 slightly warm, +2 warm, and +3 hot. The AFV was assessed as follows: −3 very stuffy, −2 stuffy, −1 slightly stuffy, 0 indifferent, +1 slightly fresh, +2 fresh, and +3 very fresh. The local thermal sensations of the forehead, chest, back, upper arm, lower arm, hand, abdomen, thigh, calf, and foot were also investigated. The perceived air quality (PAQ) (Melikov and Kaczmarczyk, 2012) was assessed using the scale of acceptability: clearly acceptable (+1), just acceptable (+0.1), just unacceptable (−0.1), and clearly unacceptable (−1). The scale of PAQ was split in the middle by points “+0.1” and “-0.1”, and continued between (−)+0.1 and (−)+1, as previous study did (Fang et al., 2004). Twelve typical SBS symptoms selected from indicators of “Sick Building Syndrome” (EPA, 1991) and previous study (Lu et al., 2016) were surveyed, including sweating, dizziness, nausea, breathing difficulty, polypnea, tachycardia, throat symptoms, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, dry skin, headaches, and sneezing. These SBS symptoms were evaluated using an intensity scale, according to the international standard (ISO, 2019): no symptoms (0), slight (1), median (2), strong (3), and extreme (4). 2.5 Statistical analysis The “Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS)” Version 22 was used for the statistical analysis including the calculation of the mean values and the significance tests from the valid data. To obtain the steady data for each condition (Zhang, 2003), only the data after 30 min of each session was collected to calculate the mean value. The local TSVs are visualized using colorful bars with scales representing different localized values. To figure out the effect of data variations/errors, a paired samples t-test was used to test the significant differences in the mean values among different conditions. The significance level P was set to be 0.05, which means the Type I statistical error α should be lower than 0.05. The actual value of α was also adjusted by “Levene's Test for Equality of variances” when the variances of two measurement cases were different. Then, the effect size (d) was calculated using equations as follows (Lan and Lian, 2010): (1) d = | x 1 ‾ − x 2 ‾ | S (2) S = ( n − 1 ) ( S 1 2 + S 2 2 ) 2 n where d = effect size, xi = mean value of case i, S = standard deviation of two measurement cases, subscripts 1 and 2 refers to the two measurement cases, n = number of participants (i.e., 16 in this study). At the last, the post hoc power analysis in G*Power 3.1 was conducted to assess the power level (1-β error), based on the actual Type I statistical error α, sample size (16) and the actual effect size (d). The β error was the type II statistical error which could be considered as the error of the t-test. The type II statistical error is set to be less than 0.2 in this study (i.e. power level (1-β) ≥ 0.8). That means only when the power level (1-β) ≥ 0.8, the significant results between two measurement cases are important. Otherwise, it is inconclusive even the significant level P ≤ 0.05 with the power level (1-β) < 0.8, which indicated that a larger sample size might be needed (see Fig. 4 ). 2.6 The index for heat stress The human body adapts to varied thermal environments through thermal physiological responses based on maintaining a heat balance between the body and surrounding environment. There are three types of heat transfer: convective, radiative, and evaporative. Thus, the total heat loss (Qi) in body part i could be expressed as: (3) Q i = H i + E i where, H i is the dry heat loss per square meter of skin in body part i, including convective and radiative heat loss, W/m2; E i is the evaporative heat loss per square meter of skin in body part i, W/m2. The details of the equations to calculate dry heat loss (H) and evaporative heat loss (E) were listed in “Appendix A. Supplementary data 3: Equations”. The value of convective heat transfer coefficient (h c) could be estimated by many different equations in different types of thermal environments (ISO, 2007). In this study, the Eq. A.7 was used, because it was obtained from the thermal environments with no wind or obvious turbulent flow. Some other equations were not suitable for this study, e.g. Eq. A.8, which was obtained from the thermal environments with high air velocity. In the predicted mean vote (PMV) model (Fanger, 1970), the difference of dry heat loss (ΔH) between actual conditions and neutral conditions was used to predict human thermal sensation. However, the difference of evaporative heat loss (ΔE) was not considered in the PMV model. Thus, to quantify the heat stress in this study, the difference of total heat loss (ΔQ) between actual conditions and neutral conditions was analyzed, which was correlated with TSV. According to the equations in Appendix A, which were derived from standards of ASHRAE Handbook (ASHRAE, 2013) and ISO-9920 (ISO, 2007), the local heat loss in different conditions could be calculated. Thus, the change of heat loss caused by physiological responses including skin temperature and sweating (i.e., ΔQp) was used as a predicted index for heat stress of human body. The values of ΔQp were calculated using the steps, as follows: (1) Calculate the heat loss using the physiological responses in neutral condition. It is assumed that the human physiological parameters in a VTD condition j are the same as that in the neutral condition of 25 °C firstly; the assumed heat loss at local body part i in the VTD condition j is the reference heat loss Qr,ij. (4) Qr, ij = f (Ta, ij, Tsk, n, Sn). Where, Ta, ij is the air temperature at the local body part i exposed to the VTD condition j; Tsk, n is the local skin temperature at neutral condition of 25 °C; Sn is the sweat intensity at the neutral condition, which is zero. (2) Calculate the actual heat loss using the actual physiological responses in thermal environments with VTD. The actual heat loss (Qij) in the corresponding VTD condition j was calculated using the actual physiological parameters as follows: (5) Qij = f (Ta,ij, Tsk, ij, Sj) Where, Tsk, ij is the actual local skin temperature in the VTD condition j; Sj is the actual sweat intensity in the VTD condition j. (3) Using the difference of heat loss caused by physiological responses as a heat stress index Thus, the local heat stress (i.e., ΔQp, ij) in thermal environments with VTD could be expressed as follows: (6) ΔQp, ij = Qij - Qr, ij Where, Qij is the actual heat loss; Qr,ij is the assumed heat loss. 3 Results 3.1 Thermal environment The thermal environmental parameters were controlled well according to the designed values during the experiments, as shown in Table 2 . In most cases, the air temperatures (T a) of the lower and upper body parts were close to the pre-design experimental conditions, and within a rate of error of ±0.3 °C. The relative humidity (RH) was within an error of ±9% in the range of 57–61%. The mean concentration of CO2 ranged from 450 to 480 ppm with a standard deviation of ±30 ppm, indicating that the rooms were well-ventilated with fresh air from outside. The air velocity was approximately 0.15 m/s at the lower body and 0.05 m/s at the upper body based on the readings of the sensors in the climatic box and climate chamber, respectively. 3.2 Thermal perceptions 3.2.1 Thermal sensation vote Fig. 5 shows the overall TSVs with different VTDs. The results showed that the mean value of overall TSV was close to zero at an air temperature of 25 °C (i.e., Td = 0 °C), meeting the preset requirement of the thermally neutral state. When the values of Td were ±3 °C, the mean values of overall TSVs were in the range of −0.5 – 0.5; the values deviated more from thermal neutrality when the upper body parts were exposed to a non-neutral environment (although there was no significant difference, P > 0.05). With a Td of +6 °C, the subjects felt significantly warmer (P < 0.05, (1-β) = 0.83) when the upper body parts were exposed to the warm condition of 31 °C than when the lower body parts were exposed. This implied that the upper body parts were more thermally sensitive, even though the areas for the surface skin temperatures at the upper and lower body parts are mostly the same (Choi et al., 1997). Thus, whether the body parts or another factor increased the sensitivities of the upper body parts needed to be further studied. Fig. 6 shows that the mean values of local TSVs were affected by Td differently, at which the color at each body part represents the value of the colorful bar at the bottom. In cooler conditions with Td = - 3 °C, the arms were cooler than other body parts. The local TSVs at some lower body parts, especially for the abdomen, were also affected by the thermal condition of the VTD at the upper body parts. However, the thermal condition at the lower body parts had an insignificant effect on the local TSVs of the upper body parts. Moreover, the local TSV at the feet was also warmer than that at the legs. The highest local TSVs were approximately 0.8 at the head and chest, when the upper body parts were exposed to a warm environment with Td = + 6 °C. 3.2.2 Perception of inhaled air During the experiments, the concentration of CO2 was approximately 450–480 ppm and not significantly different among different conditions, showing that the indoor air was well-ventilated with outside air. For most of the cool and neutral conditions, the mean values of the AFV and PAQ were approximately 0.5 ± 0.9 (slightly fresh) and 0.5 ± 0.3 (acceptable), respectively. However, the mean values of the AFV and PAQ significantly decreased (P < 0.01, (1-β)>0.8) to approximately −0.3 ± 1.0 (i.e., between indifferent and slightly stuffy) and 0.2 ± 0.3 (i.e., between just acceptable and acceptable), respectively, when the VTD values were 3 and 6 °C at the upper body parts than that of neutral condition of 25 °C. The significance tests showed that the AFV was significantly lower when Td = 3 °C, (P < 0.05, (1-β) = 0.93) at the upper body parts than that at the lower body parts. But the significant results of PAQ between different directions of VTDs were inconclusive (P < 0.05, (1-β)<0.8). That is, the VTD at the lower body non-significantly affected the AFV and PAQ, but when the VTD increased at the upper body, the AFV and PAQ were significantly decreased. 3.3 SBS symptoms The average votes of the intensities of the SBS symptoms in thermal environments with VTDs are summarized in Table 3 . The intensity of sweating was close to zero when the air temperature of all body parts was not higher than 25 °C; it increased significantly when the upper body parts are exposed to 31 °C. The intensities of sweating, dizziness, breathing difficulty, polypnea, and tachycardia were relatively higher than those of the other SBS symptoms, especially for the conditions where either the upper or lower body was exposed to 31 °C. The intensities of nausea, nasal symptoms, headache, and sneezing were relatively lower than those of other SBS symptoms, but most of them slightly increased in the conditions of 31/25 °C and 25/31 °C, probably owing to either the warm conditions or the large VTD. 3.4 Physiological responses 3.4.1 Skin temperatures Fig. 7 shows the mean skin temperatures for different values of the VTD. When the half body part was exposed to a non-neutral environment with VTD, most of the mean skin temperatures are significantly changed, except when the lower body parts were exposed to a non-neutral thermal environment with Td = 3 °C. There were no significant differences in the skin temperatures when the different body parts are exposed to the warm environments (Td = 3 and 6 °C). However, the difference was significant in the cooler conditions (Td = - 3 °C). This showed that the mean skin temperatures may be more suitable for using in thermal sensation evaluation indexes in cooler conditions than in warmer conditions (see Fig. 5). In most cases, the power level (1-β) was higher than 0.8. That means the significant results between two measurement cases are important. Otherwise, it is inconclusive even the significant level P ≤ 0.05 with the power level (1-β) < 0.8, which indicated it is difficult to make a validated conclusion of the significance test between Td = 3 °C at upper body and neutral condition (25 °C). 3.4.2 Heart rate and systolic blood pressure Both the heart rate and systolic blood pressure were slightly more sensitive to VTDs at the upper body (see Figs. S1 and S2). However, the difference between different body parts’ exposures was insignificant. There were also no significant differences in the heart rate and systolic blood pressure when the air temperature changes from 22 °C to 31 °C at the lower body. One important reason was that due to individual differences, the variations in the heart rate and blood pressure among our test subjects were higher than most of these differences caused by VTDs; this can be seen from the values of the standard deviation (SD), as shown in Figs. S1 and S2. Only when the upper body is exposed to non-neutral environments with VTDs, the heart rate was significantly different between cool (Td ≤ −3 °C) and warm (Td ≥ 3 °C) conditions. Thus, the heart rate and blood pressure might not be selectable parameters for predicting thermal comfort in thermal environments with VTDs. 4 Discussions 4.1 Analysis of heat stress Based on the method in Section 2.6, the mean heat stress of the whole body (i.e., ΔQp) is calculated using the weight factors and the value of local heat stress (ΔQp, ij) in each body part i. The results are shown in Fig. 8 . It could be clearly seen that the heat stresses were much higher when the upper body parts were exposed to non-neutral air temperatures than that of the lower body parts. Fig. 9 (a) shows the relationship between TSV and the mean heat stress of the whole body (ΔQp). Compared to the relationship between TSV and the mean skin temperature shown in Fig. 9 (b) (R2 = 0.76), the determination coefficient R2 of the linear fitting was higher (R2 = 0.95) when using the mean heat stress ΔQp as an input variable. This showed that the TSV is more correlated with the heat stress than the skin temperature alone. The difference was mainly caused by sweating in warm environments. In warm environments, the skin temperature is increased slowly or even decreased with increasing the air temperature when subjects start sweating. Since the sweating intensity is increased with increasing heat stress, the values of ΔQp could be used to predict overall TSV as follows: (7) T S V = 0.031 Δ Q p − 0.002 ; R 2 = 0.95 Thus, the acceptable mean heat stress is calculated to be between −16.1 and 16.2 W/m2 using Equation (7), which is within the thermal comfort range (−0.5< TSV < +0.5). The thermal response of human body was the potential index for thermal sensation (Khiavi et al., 2019). The evaporative heat transfer was related to the skin temperature and sweating in thermal environments with VTDs, according to the thermoregulation of human body (Deng et al., 2018; Kang et al., 2019). The sweating was triggered to maintain the core temperature of human body in warm environments (Yang et al., 2017). Merely considering the skin temperature was insufficient for quantifying the thermal stress of the human body (Wu et al., 2020b), due to sweating (Zhang and Lin, 2021). Although the skin temperature was not significantly different with different directions of VTDs in warm environments (Fig. 7), the heat stress was much higher when the upper body was exposed to a warm environment with a VTD of Td = 6 °C than when the lower body was exposed to a warm environment with a VTD of Td = 6 °C (Fig. 8). This was one important reason why the TSV was significantly higher when the upper body was exposed to a warm environment with a VTD of Td = 6 °C (Fig. 5). In the other words, this showed that the effect of directions of VTD on the TSV had its physical foundation, that is, the heat stress was actually affected by the directions of VTD. 4.2 Acceptable ranges of inhaled air temperature Expect for TSV, the thermal dissatisfaction could also be affected by other factors, e.g., the perceptions of air quality. Fig. 10 reveals the negatively linear relationships between AFV/PAQ and inhaled air temperature. These relationships were in according with the previous studies (Fang et al., 1998, 2004; Toftum et al., 1998), which argued that the perceptions of air quality were worse when the inhaled air temperature increased. This was because the warm discomfort of the upper respiratory tract had a negative effect on the acceptability of inhaled air (Brager et al., 2015; Lan et al., 2011). There were some possible reasons: one assumption was that the warm air would depress the cooling demand of the upper respiratory tract; another assumption was that the warm air at the upper body would increase the diffusion of contaminants and human bio-effluents. To compare with the categories of indoor environment standard (CEN 15251), the acceptability scale of PAQ was transferred into the percentage of dissatisfied using the method proposed by Gunnarsen and Fanger (1992). Based on the results from Fig. 11 , the air temperature at the head level should not be higher than 30.6 °C (Category IV), and better to be lower than 28.4 °C (Category I) to avoid poor inhaled air quality. On the other hand, the air temperatures at the lower body part did not significantly affect the AFV and PAQ (see Section 3.2.2). As a result, the acceptable air temperatures at the lower body part could be varied in the wide range of 22–31 °C based on the results of TSV, AFV and PAQ. However, for the breathing system, it is more important to avoid the warm air (> about 28 °C) at the head level no matter what the value of VTD at the lower body part. 4.3 Applications and limitations The results of this study showed that the subjects were more thermally sensitive to VTDs at upper body parts than that at lower body parts in warm environments. When Td is 6 °C (i.e., 31 °C) at the upper body parts, the TSV and AFV deviated significantly from the neutral/comfort levels than those at the lower body parts. The physiological responses revealed that there were greater heat stresses when the upper half-body was exposed to non-neutral environments than the lower half-body. However, the results of this study were derived from the climate chamber experiments in thermal environments with half body parts separated from each other; this might be different from the practical thermal environments in buildings served by common air distribution systems. But, the results derived from this study can help further understand human comfort in environments with VTDs, where the effects of the VTD directions were identified. Overall, the results from both this study and previous studies (Liu et al., 2017b; Möhlenkamp et al., 2019; Schiavon et al., 2016b) implied that the air temperature at the upper body (or breathing level) might be a more vital factor in thermal comfort than the VTD alone. This could be helpful to understand the thermal responses and comfort requirements of occupants in thermal environments with VTD, and improve indoor air distribution. In cooling conditions, it could be efficient to remove the human heat and bio-effluents emission by delivering the cool air to the region of upper body (or breathing zone). Thus, based on this result, both the energy efficiency and thermal comfort could be reasonably optimized when designing an air distribution system (Cui et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2015). Only the vertical air temperature differences were focused in this study, while other parameters were considered as fixed values. However, the effects of other parameters cannot be ignored, which was one of the limitations of this study. It should be mentioned that probably no existing air distribution system could create the same negative VTDs with the same air velocity and air temperature as that in this climate chamber study. But, the effective draft temperature (Wu et al., 2022) at different body parts in this study might be similar with some application scenarios. For example, in some personal air supply (Kang et al., 2019) and stratum ventilation (Lin et al., 2009) systems, the cool air is delivered directly to the upper area of occupants which was partly separated from the lower body by the desk, creating lower effective draft temperature at upper body than the area under the desk. In these cases, the values of effective draft temperature could be the same as that in this study, although the air velocity at head level could be higher than 0.1 m/s as that in this study. The negative VTDs with low air velocity could be also found in the scenarios using asymmetric radiation panel heating/cooling systems, when the draft cold air blocked the buoyancy of warm air (Lu, 2020). With more experiments in comprehensive indoor environments in future, the standard effective temperature (DA., 1980) could be considered as a more robust index. The acceptable ranges of inhaled air temperature from this study were only suitable for cooling season with normal relative humidity and no wind. These also could be varied in other conditions such as with different air velocities, relative humidity and pollutants. Besides that, this study was conducted using college students during a hot summer period. Thus, the conclusions of this study were suitable for young adults in the cooling season. The special populations, such as children and elderly, might respond differently (Wu et al., 2019a). Other factors (Wu et al., 2020a, 2021a), such as gender (Zhang and Zhu, 2022), occupations (Wu et al., 2019c), life-styles (Wu et al., 2019b), and activity levels (Yasmeen et al., 2020) might also make the conclusions in this study differ from the actual feelings in “real world” buildings (Wu et al., 2021b). These issues need to be studied in future. 5 Conclusions This study presented researches on the effect of the directions of vertical air temperature difference (VTD) on the subjective and physiological responses of occupants. There were six different thermal conditions with either the upper or lower body exposed to non-neutral conditions, as compared to a uniform neutral condition of 25 °C. The main results are as follows. The test subjects were more thermally sensitive to the VTD at the upper body parts with respect to the thermal sensation vote (TSV), air freshness vote (AFV), perceived air quality (PAQ), and heat stress. With a Td of +6 °C, the subjects felt significantly warmer (P < 0.05, (1-β) = 0.83) when the upper body parts were exposed to the warm condition of 31 °C than when the lower body parts were exposed. Due to the effect of inhaled air temperature, the VTD at the lower body non-significantly affected the AFV and PAQ, but when the VTD increased at the upper body, the AFV and PAQ were significantly decreased (P < 0.01, (1-β) > 0.8). The skin temperatures of the test subjects changed significantly with variations in the VTD values in most cases (P ≤ 0.05, (1-β) > 0.8). The heart rate was less sensitive to VTD than the skin temperatures, and a significant difference was only found between cool (Td = −3 °C) and warm (Td = +3 and + 6 °C) conditions with VTD at the upper body parts. The blood pressure was insensitive to thermal environments with VTD. Based on the analysis of thermoregulation, the heat stress of human body was much higher for positive VTDs than negative VTDs with the same value. The results of AFV, PAQ and SBS also indicated that there was more discomfort for positive VTDs than negative VTDs with the same value. Thus, the criterion for acceptable negative VTDs should be different with the positive VTDs incorporated in current standards. The directions of the VTD were suggested to be considered while evaluating the thermal sensation or heat stress of occupants in thermal environments with VTD. This implied that it could be more efficient for body heat removal to cool the upper body in warm environments.
