Global Centre for Clean Air Research (GCARE) Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences University of Surrey Guildford GU2 7XH United Kingdom The elderly population is relatively vulnerable to air pollution and thermal stress due to their low mobility and high prevalence of chronic disorders. Appropriate green infrastructure (GI) deployment can improve both the indoor and outdoor air quality and thermal environments of elderly care centres (ECCs), yet a systematic review on this topic area is lacking. This review aims to fill this gap by investigating the impacts of GI on ECC building environment and presents the approaches for integrating GI into the building environment design. We discussed the significance of linking air quality with the thermal environment to ECCs and the effects of GI on the elderly's physical health. We investigated the key design considerations for GI in ECC buildings (e.g., spatial layout, species, aesthetics and fire prevention). Also, the diversity of monitoring and modelling approaches for evaluating the benefits of GI in indoor and outdoor environments was assessed. Finally, we evaluated the associated challenges and provided design recommendations for improving the environments in and around the ECC buildings (e.g., bedrooms, indoor gardens, green roofs and courtyards). The quantitative evidence for linking GI with indoor and outdoor air pollution and extreme heat around the ECC buildings are limited. However, this evidence-base is important for providing generic advice to the building designers and the elderly. Further studies such as the evaluation criteria and monitoring standard are required to develop holistic design recommendations for ECC buildings. The empirical research about the social and economic impacts is also necessary to facilitate the sustainable development of the ageing societies. Graphical abstract Image 1 Keywords Elderly population and health Green infrastructure Indoor and outdoor environments Air quality and thermal environment Building environment design Monitoring and modelling 1 Introduction Ageing of the population has become a challenging issue in global countries. They are vulnerable to air pollution and thermal stress, owing to issues such as low mobility and high prevalence of chronic disorders [1,2]. In 2020, there were approximately 727 million people aged 65 or over, which accounts for 9.3% of the global population, and it is expected to rise to over 1.5 billion by 2050, thus representing 16.0% [3]. Urbanisation is accompanied by environmental threats such as increased traffic, air pollution, intensified urban heat island effect (UHI), and the loss of open green space. Many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of green infrastructure (GI) in improving air quality and thermal environments at multiple spatial scales (Large-, medium-, small-, and micro-scale) in urban areas [4–16]. However, few works have focused on elderly care centres (ECCs) [17–19]. ECCs are the prominent concentration places of elderly people, providing accommodation, timely medical resources and 24-h support [20–22]. Investigating approaches to improve the ECC building environment through the GI is essential for facilitating the development of age-friendly societies. Existing studies have summarised the correlation between indoor and outdoor air pollutant concentrations and thermal environments, and the GI methods (e.g., trees; lawns, hedges and shrubs; green roofs and green walls; green spaces and parks) to improve the building environment and the health of the elderly (e.g., increase longevity, enhance immune function and reduce incidence of disease). They have extensively investigated the topic by reducing exposure to air pollution and mitigating the UHI effect, exploring the key design considerations of indoor and outdoor GI (spatial layout, species, aesthetics and fire prevention), and providing basic approaches of GI monitoring and modelling for validation and prediction. However, the following aspects need to be strengthened: (1) quantitative results and rules that can be used widely for improving indoor and outdoor environments in and around ECCs by GI; and (2) building environment design of ECCs. Limited studies have made it challenging for most policymakers and designers to establish a suitable building environment for ECCs. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first review to summarise how the building environment of ECCs can be optimised through GI, combining building environment design disciplines with monitoring and modelling techniques (Fig. 1 ), and present the quantitative challenges and recommendations for the future improvement of urban ECCs from both design and environmental engineering perspectives. This review will be helpful for the sustainable development of ageing cities worldwide. The overall aim of the review is to synthesise both the air quality and thermal comfort environment in and outside of ECC buildings. It specifically aims to address the following questions: (1) how GI can help to improve air quality and thermal environments in and outside of ECC buildings; and (2) how GI can help toward improving the building environment design of ECCs. This review is divided into seven sections: introduction (Section 1), GI and the health of the elderly (Section 2), and scope and methods (Section 3). In order to understand this topic in depth, Section 4 synthesises the studies aiming at the question of improving the building environment of ECCs by GI. Section 5 discusses the challenges to overcome GI around ECC building settings, followed by providing recommendations for adopting GI in ECC building environment design (Section 6) and summary of findings and an outlook for future research (Section 7). 2 GI and the health of the elderly The effects of GI on the elderly remained uncertain, as it is context dependent and partially overridden by socioeconomic confounders [3,23]. GI helps to increase longevity, enhance immune function and reduce morbidity (e.g., stroke, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, circulatory disease, obesity [24–35] (Fig. 2 ). An Australian study has shown that exposure to the highest level of GI was 37% less likely to result in hospitalisation for heart disease or stroke [30]. A Canadian study indicated that the increase in the interquartile range of green space was related to a reduction in non-accident mortality, using a 500 m buffer (ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval = 0.94–0.96) [36]. Furthermore, GI can be detrimental to the elderly, not only because of inappropriate Gl forms inhibiting the exposure of air pollutants or hot air, but also due to the production of pollen and biogenic volatile organic compounds (bVOCs) [37,38]. With regard to bVOCs, it has acute and chronic negative effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems of humans [39] due to the production of ground-level ozone and particles [40–42]. However, communities with well-placed GI tend to have wealthy residents who have healthy lifestyles and can easily access high quality health care services [10]. By contrast, residents living in communities with fewer GI are usually poorer and have fewer opportunities to health care services [10]. In order to improve the building environment of older people, a quantitative relationship between GI and air quality and thermal environment is recommended to explore. 3 Scope and methods This review investigates how to improve the ECC building environment by GI. The building environment comprises spaces such as bedrooms, dining rooms, shops, communal lounges, bathrooms, nurses' stations, corridors, balconies, terraces, internal courtyards, roofs, parks or any indoor and outdoor space accessible to the elderly [20–22,43,44]. The scope of this review is the ‘physical health’ of elderly people within ECCs in urban areas. We only discuss older people's mental health and wellbeing in ECCs briefly for the completeness of the topic area and guide the readers to relevant references to detailed studies on these topics. We adopt systematic literature review approach (SLR) based on PRISMA to identify, screen and filter appropriate, peer-reviewed and grey literature from various scientific databases (Fig. 3 ): English databases (Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus) and Chinese databases (CNKI and Wan-Fang), which are comprehensive and cover a wide range of areas in various disciplines. The following keywords and phrases are used: ‘ageing’, ‘elderly people’, ‘older people’, ‘older adult’, ‘older ages', ‘elderly care centre/buildings', ‘aged care homes/buildings', ‘nursing home’, ‘physical health’, ‘green infrastructure’, ‘vegetation’, ‘indoor gardens', ‘indoor plants', ‘green walls', ‘green space’, ‘green roofs', ‘green balconies/terraces', 'trees', ‘lawns,’, ‘hedges and shrubs', ‘garden’, ‘park’, ‘air quality’, ‘air pollution’, ‘traffic pollution’, ‘thermal environment’, ‘thermal stress', ‘thermal comfort’, ‘urban heat island’, ‘microclimate’, ‘monitoring’, ‘modelling’, ‘simulation’, ‘building environment design’, ‘indoor design’, ‘landscape design’, ‘spatial layout’, 'species', 'aesthetics', 'access' and ‘fire prevention’. Our search is limited to publications in English and Chinese in the last 20 years. This search has resulted in 10,015 articles; of which 9006 articles are eliminated because of their low relevance. The remaining 1009 articles are then further screened for content and study focus. Other relevant articles may have been excluded because of the language and search of the database. Finally, 219 appropriate articles are discussed in detail. Fig. 4 shows that only 7.74% and 4.87% of the studies are relevant to design and ECCs, respectively. Most of the works are from Europe (47.95%) and Asia (28.31%). 4 GI and the building environment of elderly population in ECCs To design age-friendly building environments in ECCs through the GI, the two fundamental aspects are required to employ: (1) improving the indoor and outdoor air quality, as well as the thermal environments around the elderly people (walkable and wheelchair-assisted); and (2) developing the building environment design (i.e., ECC space design) with monitoring and modelling techniques. 4.1 Improving indoor and outdoor air quality Traffic emissions are the important sources of air pollution in cities around the world [45–49]. These pollutants can include particulate matters ≤10 μm (PM10), ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5), ultrafine particles (UFP <100 nm), and gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), as well as sulphur dioxide (SO2) [10]. These contribute to increasing air pollution exposure in ‘on-road’, ‘near-road’ and ‘far-road’ microenvironments [50,51]. Twenty-four hours mean PM2.5 concentration suggested by WHO was 25 μg m−3 [52], yet Kumar et al. [50] found that the on-road PM2.5 concentrations of many global cities were much higher. It has both short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) adverse effects, even at the low levels of concentration exposure, on cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality among elderly people [53–60]. Elderly people spend most of the time indoors, where outdoor pollutants can ingress indoors due to routes such as through the door or window openings [5,18–21]. To protect the health of the elderly, restricting the spread of traffic pollution from roads to ECC buildings is necessary. For example, Hoek et al. [61] examined that the relative risk of all-cause mortality and cardiopulmonary mortality for older adults (age 55–69 years) living within 50 m of a major road, or 100 m of a highway were 1.41 and 1.95, respectively. Woodward and Levine [62] indicated that ECCs should be located at least 152.4 m from the major roads (around 100,000 vehicles per day) to reduce the risk of unnecessary fatalities. However, there is no ‘safe’ distance in dense urban areas [63]. Accordingly, measures to reduce exposure of ECCs to traffic air pollution include increasing the distance to the source, eliminating the exhaust emissions from the source itself, and/or adopting passive solutions such as GI barriers between the source and the receptor [62–65]. Common characteristics of GI that can help reduce exposure to air pollution include: (1) vegetation density or porosity; (2) pollutant removal and dispersion; (3) physical dimensions (e.g., length, thickness, height and spacing); and (4) specific characteristics (e.g., seasonal variation, vegetation emissions and air pollution tolerance index, leaf thickness, and presence of hairs or waxes on the surface [6,7]. Previous studies have found that the total air pollutant removal rates by GI in congested cities were 0.2–1.4%, 0.1–0.8%, 0.001–0.003%, 0.1–0.7% and 0.1–0.5% for PM10, O3, CO, SO2 and NO2, respectively [5]. Green walls (GWs) and green roofs (GRs) are essential in densely populated urban areas [66–69]. A 5m-high building with 75% GR coverage and a 10m-high building with 50% GR coverage can both minimise PM2.5 at pedestrian level [70]. Regardless of the height of the GW, these were reported to capture the highest PM2.5 with 25% green coverage [70]. The discussion reveals that further research is warranted on the safe distance from roads to ECC buildings and appropriate building environment design with GI for improving both the indoor and outdoor environments in and around the ECC (Fig. 5 a). Starting with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, this topic becomes even more valuable. You and Pan [71] found that each 1% increase of urban GI helps to reduce 2.6% COVID-19 cases. The evidence base can help in developing a quantitative insight for the building designers and urban planners. 4.2 Mitigating UHI effect and maintaining comfortable indoor environment UHI effect is highly influenced by urban form (e.g., traffic, building height, anthropogenic heat sources) and is associated with an increase in hospital admissions of older adults with respiratory and renal disease in particular [72–81]. A 1 °C increase in the intensity of the UHI may lead to a 5.49% relative increase in suicide mortality among the elderly [82]. Urban parks are 0.94 °C on average cooler than non-green urban sites and space under trees are 0.8 °C on average cooler than space around the trees [83,84]. The cooling effect of a park can extend up to 1.25 km [83]. Apart from the evaporative cooling of vegetation, a well-designed trade-off between trees and lawns can result in more shade cover for day-time thermal comfort and less obstruction of airflow for night-time cooling [83–85]. The shade, evaporation and transpiration of GI influences the local outdoor climate that can in turn affect the indoor temperature, relative humidity, air velocity and energy savings (e.g., air conditioning) [5,83]. The indoor air temperature can be reduced by 3 °C and the cooling energy can be saved by over 13% per year due to the shade of the adjacent trees [5]. Additionally, the averages of surface cooling for green walls and green roofs are 1.8 °C and 2 °C, respectively [84–88], while the indoor cooling with the green walls and green roofs is approximately 2 °C [5]. However, microclimate regulation of GI for indoors is complex due to the characteristics of building (e.g., forms, materials, air-tightness and ventilation) and GI (e.g., evaporation rate, surface shading and surface roughness) [4,89,90]. Many studies have addressed the UHI effect and thermal needs of the elderly, yet few works have focused on GI in relation to ECC indoors [90–103]. To obtain cooling effects in seasons, Zong et al. [18] suggested having 130–4000 m2 GI gardens for ECCs. Baldwin et al. [17] highlighted four potential topics: (1) quantitative co-benefits of GI on elderly residents, staff, visitors, and surrounding neighbourhoods; (2) GI's life-cycle costs; (3) GI and landscape design; and (4) GI's policy and land-use planning mechanisms. The insights highlight the importance of quantifying the links between the activities of elderly people (e.g., sitting, standing, walking and running) and the micro-climatic environments influenced by GI in ECC buildings such as GRs, indoor gardens and bedrooms with GWs. Some elderly people living in ECCs have disabilities that prevent them from leaving hot areas in a timely manner while the staff may not always be aware of their thermal needs due to various thermal sensitivities. Taking GRs as an example, geometric patterns of planting (Fig. 5b), canopy coverage rate and species configuration should be quantified with solar radiation, temperature, humidity and wind speed. 4.3 Improving building environment design Designers usually focus on building or landscape design rather than human health. However, this can cause a failure to achieve a high standard of building environment due to the strong correlation between indoor and outdoor [104,105] that is particularly detrimental to elderly people who have high incidence of chronic diseases and usually spend most time in one space [106–108]. GI design considerations, combined with improving thermal environment and air quality, are known as thermal-scape and air-scape [109,110], which are at the intersection of environmental engineering, building design and landscape design discipline, including the measurable environmental properties (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, temperature, humidity, wind speed), thermal comfort, and social culture [109,110]. Thermal-scape and air-scape can be divided into natural landscapes and artificial landscapes (e.g., GWs, GRs). In order to make GI design reasonable for both indoor and outdoor air quality and thermal environments, it mainly relied on monitoring and simulation, yet artistic translations of the original data are lacking. The following design considerations are highly recommended: (1) spatial layout of GI; (2) species of GI; (3) aesthetics on GI; and (4) fire prevention. Moreover, monitoring and modelling methods should be considered for predicting and validating environmental conditions. 4.3.1 Indoor design considerations With regard to the spatial layout of GI inside of the buildings, it requires employing the following steps: (1) focus on the indoor major living spaces for the elderly such as bedrooms, canteens and communal lounges [99,101]; (2) design indoor gardens, green balconies and green roofs that the elderly can access without leaving the building; such a GI incorporation is also referred to as ‘vertical forest’ in numerous design projects [66,67]; and (3) avoid safety risks such as scratches, slips and falls [107]. These are expected to be considered at the first building environment design stage in relation to the air quality, thermal environment and low-carbon emissions. As for the placement of GI in the indoor area, designers should consider four fundamental aspects: (1) sufficient sunlight for indoor plants [5]; (2) adequate ventilation and sunlight in the room [5,14,99] (3) appropriate shade (e.g., green walls); [5]; and (4) safety as the major concern [43]. In terms of the indoor GI's aesthetics, two categories are expected to understand: (1) relationship between GI aesthetics and spatial distribution and environmental control of ECC buildings [111,112]; and (2) GI in indoor design (e.g., geometric planting walls and decorative green furniture) to allow the elderly to experience the GI air-scape and thermal-scape in terms of vision and human comfort [111,112]. The above implies that to maximise the positive impact of GI on the health of the elderly indoors, there is a need to understand the relationships between indoor and outdoor environments, and incorporate the knowledge of environmental engineering, building environment design and building construction. 4.3.2 Outdoor design considerations The outdoor GI influences the outdoor air quality and thermal environment around ECCs, along with further benefits on the indoor conditions [5]. The improvement of the spatial layout of outdoor GI could be attributed to: (1) high-quality thermal-scape and air-scape space design, wherein people can choose spaces outdoors depending on their thermal comfort or visual perceptions [111,112]; (2) walk-able GI spaces which have positive impacts on the longevity of the elderly [113–120]; and (3) suitable GI network system, which influences indoor and outdoor environments and indoor energy use positively [29,111]. For species of GI adjacent to the ECC building, the major recommendations are: (1) to choose trees, lawns, hedges, shrubs, GWs or GRs according to the possibility of obtaining high quality environmental parameters (e.g., PM2.5 and air temperature) in local sites (e.g., distance to the road, building height to street width ratio and orientation towards the sun) [111,121]; (2) to avoid accidental injuries: thorny species or species that carry poisonous fruits should not be planted around ECCs, because the elderly have thinner and drier skin that can be easily damaged [122–125]; (3) to avoid plants that carry plenty of pollen and bVOCs; and (4) to avoid the spread of zoonotic diseases [126,127]. In terms of the aesthetics, elderly people would expect good GI visual perception when looking out of windows and they have higher levels of thermal comfort in beautiful GI environments [128–130]. Elderly people may have various preferences because of degeneration of the retina, cornea, pupil and lens of their eyes [131–139]. Visual features of GI such as form, colour contrast, height, canopy size and texture, may have therapeutic effects on their health [140–142]. The above indicates that elderly people have special needs for GI design due to the association among indoor and outdoor environments, their fragile immune systems, reduced mobility, memory loss and reduced vision. Apart from the aforementioned design considerations, fire prevention is critical (Fig. 6 ). Vegetation fires produce PM10, PM2.5 and greenhouse gases that may affect the local climate, air quality and health of the vulnerable group [143]. Most public spaces have clear escape routes in the event of a fire, yet escaping from a building with a green wall or in an indoor garden with many flammable plants at the fastest time and closest distance is still challenging for the elderly. It would have a rapid and detrimental effect on the building safety, air quality and thermal environment, which should also find specific solutions in the future. 4.3.3 Design verification methods 4.3.3.1 Environmental monitoring Building environment design can be improved by monitoring and modelling techniques through prediction and validation. Monitoring relies on survey questionnaires, site measurements, remote monitoring and statistical analyses [144–146]. The following considerations are important before monitoring: (1) whether the technology is acceptable to elderly people; (2) operational needs, e.g., whether real-time charging is required; (3) vulnerability to human damage; (4) accuracy of the instrument; (5) cost; and (6) lifetime of the instrument and maintenance needs [147]. Table 1 summarises the most relevant monitoring studies in relation to GI and the building environment [148–152]. The aforementioned discussions have allowed to understand the diversity in approaches of indoor and outdoor monitoring. However, monitoring ECCs is challenging due to uncontrollable variables. For example, it is difficult to accurately compare two ECCs in one city with different levels of GI because the physical condition of the elderly residents, the climatic conditions, the building environments and the traffic conditions cannot be entirely the same. Therefore, a comprehensive GI monitoring standard for the ECC is recommended to explore. 4.3.3.2 Modelling environment Table 2 indicates that many studies have assessed indoor and outdoor air quality and thermal environments with modelling techniques on urban buildings and street canyons [153–164]. They found that idealised numerical models are able to describe quantitative relationships in the relevant topics. For example, the results of Figs. 5 and 6 can be obtained from a diverse set of modelling scenarios. However, few studies addressed the building environment of ECCs because: (1) modelling is not yet compatible with software commonly used in the architectural discipline [158]; and (2) some people consider modelling only to be performed a few times during the building design or construction process [165–167]. Only a handful of studies, such as Gao [168] summarised the effects of plant species configurations on the thermal environment in an ECC through CFD simulations. 5 Challenges to overcome implementation of GI around ECC buildings The discussion highlights the following challenges that are important to overcome: (1) Building environment design with GI: Low ignition point of GI makes it difficult for residents to escape in the event of a fire, for instance, in a vertical forest building. Extensive planting on building walls may affect the daylight and ventilation of indoors. (2) GI evaluation criteria: This may be based on a number of quantitative rules for air pollution reduction, microclimate regulation, and building environment design improvement, such as: i) safe distance from road to ECC buildings; ii) GI coverage adjacent to the ECC building; iii) quantification between GI and indoor pollutants, indoor thermal environment, and reduction of indoor energy consumption; and iv) the fastest time and closest distance for the elderly to escape from the space with many flammable plants. The evaluation criteria should focus on indoor spaces such as the bedrooms, dining rooms and common rooms, where the elderly usually spend the majority of their time. To expand the use of the criteria, challenges of existing and new ECCs are necessary to address separately. Most of the building environment (e.g., ECCs) will have been constructed by 2050 [169]. Therefore, the limitations of deploying GI in existing ECCs will become a prominent issue. (3) GI monitoring standard: Generic conclusion is difficult to summarise because the ECCs' environments have many uncontrollable variables (i.e., climatic conditions, built environments and traffic conditions). To set the standard, the key considerations include: i) the placement of monitoring equipment (e.g., location and duration of monitoring) [147]; ii) expectations of the air quality and thermal environment that can be achieved [170–174]; iii) acceptance of the monitoring process by the elderly residents [150]; iv) health risks [150]; and v) rapid analysis of monitoring results [173–176]. Moreover, the smart GI Network should be considered as an important part of the standard to realize long-term sustainability [177–182]. It would allow to monitor the environmental quality of GI spaces in real-time and make informed decisions [177] (e.g., provide visual advice to elderly people on how long they are encouraged to stay in any local environment). (4) Unexpected challenges such as COVID-19, extreme heat, and sandstorms [183–193]: There may be significant differences between natural science and epidemiology in addressing these challenges. Thus, there is a need to develop a systematic framework around the ECCs settings. 6 Design recommendations To provide a clear idea about the implementation of GI for improving the building environment of ECCs, the overall method has been described in Fig. 7 . A holistic framework of the building environment design guidelines is recommended to respond to the research gaps and challenges. The guidelines should be able to offer generic recommendations to building designers and urban planners that are not always based on specific locations [194–204]. These may include, but not limited to: (1) quantify the spatial layout of GI with air pollution and extreme heat, especially in bedrooms, common rooms and dining rooms where elderly people spend a lot of time; (2) summarise the species of plant that predispose to common diseases in older age groups; (3) quantify the association of GI species (trees, lawns, hedges, shrubs, green roofs or green walls) with the most appropriate ratio of building height to street width; (4) summarise the GI aesthetic preferences of elderly people based on their ageing eyes and design perspectives (e.g., indoor views and views out of windows); (5) identify accessible design in GI spaces. High accessibility encourages elderly people with all types of physical conditions to enjoy the local climate and air quality of GI spaces [205–214] (6) quantify escape rules in GI space (e.g., vertical forest building); once a fire occurs. Plants always have a low ignition point and are prone to ignite. If a fire occurs, ECCs will be more vulnerable than the other built environments because elderly people walk more slowly than others [215–219]; and (7) integrate monitoring and modelling techniques to predict and validate ECC design projects from the beginning. 7 Conclusion and future outlook This review investigated how the GI can improve the air quality and thermal environment of ECC buildings for the elderly people and how its benefits can be incorporated into age-friendly building environment design. We highlighted research gaps and challenges for GI consideration in the context of ECCs, and accordingly, made recommendations for future research in generating GI design guidance and providing monitoring and modelling tools for improving the indoor and outdoor environments of ECCs. Overall, we drew key concepts and findings from the published literature to summarise ways for improving the building environment of ECCs through the GI. The key conclusions are as follows: 1. The physical health of the elderly in the ECC building environment is highly influenced by the inter-linkage of indoor and outdoor air quality and thermal environments. However, the quantitative relationships are still unclear. 2. ECC building environment design should primarily consider GI with spatial layout (e.g., bedrooms, dining rooms and common rooms where the elderly usually stay), species, aesthetics and fire prevention. 3. Design can be verified though environmental monitoring and modelling methods for improving the building environment. 4. A number of challenges exist for the future research, such as GI evaluation criteria, monitoring standard (e.g., smart GI network), building environment design with GI and unexpected challenges (i.e., COVID-19 and extreme heat). Yet, the quantitative analysis will allow to establish comprehensive ECC building design guidelines. This review investigated the current GI approaches that could improve the environment in and outside of ECC buildings. Future work is needed to produce systematic guidelines to draw generic conclusions and recommendations for facilitating age-friendly societies at multiple scales. The review is limited in terms of its relevant quantitative relationship with social and economic development, which can be explored in future research.
