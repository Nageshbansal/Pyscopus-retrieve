Vernacular dwelling, based on climate responsive experience, become the focused topic currently. However, an in-depth review of these existing studies is still missing. In this context, this research presents a review of 55 previous studies since 2010, including the quantitative and the qualitative description of the research topics, research methodologies, and corresponding main findings by using the clustering analysis, the statistical analysis and the classification analysis. The results could be grouped into three categories: climate responsiveness of vernacular buildings, adaptive thermal comfort of residents, climate adaptability of both buildings and residents, and the vernacular dwelling climate responsiveness is the mainstream. In addition, approximately 83.64% of the studies used quantitative research methods, which is the field and simulation study, to verify the effectiveness of strategies. And the relationship between strategies and building were not single mapped. In order to explore the connection between these two, a further classification by season, location and elements is conducted. Finally, this research indicates that more rigorous quantitative research and more scenarios, especially future climate adaption, are necessary for future exploration in this field. This research aims to demonstrate a clear and effective overview of this field for further promotion of architecture sustainability. Keywords Climatic responsive Vernacular dwelling Quantitative review Bioclimatology Research process 1 Introduction The building sector has a significant environment impact due to its responsibility for approximately 30% of greenhouse gas emissions and 40% of energy consumption worldwide [1]. 40–45% of the total energy consumption, in EU countries, came from the building sector [2]. And in China, the total life-cycle carbon emissions from buildings accounts for 51.2% of the national energy carbon emissions by the end of 2018 [3]. Facing the risk of energy depletion, global warming and climate change, it is a necessary and urgent topic for all countries to reduce the building energy consumption while maintain the indoor thermal environment. Climate, which is the external condition of thermal environment for buildings, is a very important parameter in low energy consumption and high comfort design process of architectures [4]. Most modern residential architectures require high energy consumption in order to resist adverse outdoor climate and maintain a comfortable indoor environment. Heating and cooling of residential buildings consumes about 10% of the world's energy [5]. However, vernacular dwelling, typically found in rural areas, has the maximum adaptability to local climate, topography and social culture [6,7]. It is a self-built architecture using the local material and the affordable technology based on knowledge achieved through trial and error [8–10]. Accordingly, vernacular architecture is recognized as a source of inspiration which could provide an effect solution for humans [11,12]. The importance of vernacular dwellings wisdom about deal with climate has attracted many researchers’ attention. Nevertheless, a systematic review of the existing literature is still missing in this field, which not only hinders the deeper study of relationship between vernacular dwellings, climate and human in different regions, but also fails to provide direction and suggestions for future exploration. As a result, our research team focused on investigating and organizing literatures about the climate responsiveness of vernacular dwelling to help further researches. Then this study clarified the relevant concepts and presenting the research methodologies. Besides, this research introduced the most common research methods, processes, and corresponding concise conclusions. Finally, it defined the research gap and providing suggestions for future exploration. 2 Methodology 2.1 Background Climate responsiveness means that, within the local climate, people meet their own indoor environmental needs through the passive strategies and the simplest construction methods, which lead to less energy demand, less CO2 emission and more comfortable indoor thermal environment [2,13]. As a similar concept with climate responsiveness, the bioclimatology in vernacular dwellings field also tries to interpret relationship between climate, human and building [14]. Table 1 shows the detail information of these two concepts which have same cores and aim. However, vernacular dwelling with climate responsiveness is not only created from climate conditions, but also affected by local culture, construction technology, value concept, etc. Namely, the study of climate responsiveness in vernacular building, as summarized in Fig. 1 , is a part of study of environmental responsiveness, whereas, bioclimatic analysis is more about climate. Except for guiding principle mentioned above, there is still a difference in generating process between two concepts. Responsiveness is a post research, from existing data of climate and dwelling, to find the dwelling's wisdom. However, bioclimatic research is from climate conditions to building characteristic, which is a forward process based on climate and neglect other influence factors and processes, showing in Fig. 2 . Due to the consistency of research objectives and contents, bioclimatic research can be incorporated into this review study. Besides, most of the papers adopted a comprehensive approach, which firstly use bio-climate method to analysis climate conditions and strategies, then identify the climate strategies from architectural typology, finally confirm the strategy results by each other. Therefore, both of them are parts of this study. Nevertheless, as shown in Table 1, we should aware that there is still a clear difference between climate responsiveness and bioclimatology in vernacular dwellings fields. 2.2 Research method As a sub-field of the scientometrics research, the scientometrics mapping, which has become an increasingly popular method of reviewing in recent years, has been widely used in the field of architecture [15–18]. In general, the general workflow of a scientometric mapping study includes data retrieval, preprocessing, network extraction, normalization, mapping, analysis, visualization, and interpretation of the conclusions obtained [19,20]. However, scientometrics mapping, actually, is an empirical and objective method of analyzing a field of knowledge, lacking details of literatures with perspectives of expertise. Therefore, this study combines the scientometrics mapping method with data analysis from architecture, expecting to have a more comprehensive understanding of climate responsiveness in vernacular dwellings. 2.2.1 Stage 1-data collection and data pre-processing This research was carried out by using “Web of Science (WOS)” databases with the Search string “(climate adapta* OR climate response* OR climate strategies OR climate suitability) AND (dwelling OR house OR residence OR settlement OR architecture OR building) AND (traditional OR native OR indigenous OR folk OR vernacular OR local)”. WOS is selected and adopted as it is one of the most widespread academic databases [21–24]. Besides, the using of synonyms ensured the comprehensive searching result including 6812 documents. The first step of further selection was searching English articles in the database named “Web of Science Core Collection”. Then to filter the documents by high level journals and titles, abstracts. After screening, 48 documents met the requirements. In order to confirm the concept in section 2.1, this study used search string “(bioclimat*) AND (dwelling OR house OR residence OR settlement OR architecture OR building) AND (traditional OR native OR indigenous OR folk OR vernacular OR local) ” for the second search, getting 17 papers totally. Ten of them were identical with the initial search results which means they used both these two concepts, and the remaining papers are relevant to this study due to same aims and core. Ultimately, 55papers were recognized and included in this study. Fig. 3 shows the literature selection process which happened in 12/22/2021. 2.2.2 Analytical method 2.2.2.1 Stage 2-bibliometric analysis Bibliometric analysis refers to the mapping and visualization of specific large-scale scientific data sets in the knowledge domain, which could help researchers quickly analyze the knowledge pattern in this field and carry out research plans [20,25]. In order to have a preliminary understanding in the main knowledge areas of selected literature, keywords were extracted, clustered and analyzed by VOSviewer software which is an open source tool with good compatibility with Web of Science (www.vosviewer.com) [25]. VOSviewer, one of the most recommended tools in the literature, is used to generate scientific drawings and visualizations [16,26]. 2.2.2.2 Stage 3-data analysis All of the above selected papers were downloaded in a folder called "review article” which is the database for this study. In addition, an Excel file was created for further data analysis. Data analysis refers to the quantitative analysis of 55 papers with the aim of providing a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of this field. The data analysis includes four steps, including Data Coding: DC, Information Extraction: IE, Classification Analysis: CA, Framework Proposed: FP. Firstly, it is supposed to code all data based on year facilitates subsequent research and avoids confusion, while detecting changes in the data over time. Secondly, it is a complex task to extract key information from all the data, as the research area, content, method, research results of these articles need be extracted to help fully understand this field. Thirdly, classification analysis is carried out to merge data with certain common attributes or features. Due to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the content of articles in this database, our research team could only start with a preliminary clustering analysis by VOSviewer. The classification results are then determined by the cluster results and a comprehensive mastery of the database. With this approach, the study content and research methods as well as the results are categorized effectively. Finally, a review research framework about the workflow of this research is presented, and the research gap and suggestions for future exploration are defined. 3 Result 3.1 Bibliometric statistics 3.1.1 Keywords clustering based on word relation. Keywords recognize and reflect the core themes of the study domain's area [27]. In VOSviewer, keyword is represented by a circle whose size is related to the number of occurrences and the distance between circles shows the correlation between terms, which means the smaller distance, the more co-occurrences [28]. The clustering results of this research are shown in Fig. 4 . The network has three keyword clusters in Fig. 4 (a) and each cluster is identified with different colors: red, green, blue, including 12 items, 11items and 6 items respectively. “Performance” (occurrences = 15) is in a prominent position in the red cluster, surrounded by “vernacular architecture” (13), “thermal performance” (10), “structure” (10), “investigation” (8). The green cluster is related to “dwelling” (17), “simulation” (12), “field investigation/measurement” (12), “climate responsive design/strategy” (12) and “indoor thermal comfort” (8). The blue cluster focuses in “survey” (13), “resident” (9) and “person” (8), “adaptive thermal comfort” (5). These three clusters overlap each other, indicating that they have similar themes and overlapping research content. In addition, it is clear to find out that “dwelling”, “performance”, “dwelling”, “resident”, “simulation” “survey” has high density in keywords (Fig. 4b) and “adaptive thermal comfort”, “resident”, “outdoor temperature”, “field investigation/measurement” is hot topics in recent years (Fig. 5 ). 3.1.1 The distribution of the research area Fig. 6 based on the Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification [29] shows the present and future climate map and the geographic distribution of 55 cases investigated. The research sites for each paper are represented on the map by a grey transparent dot. Among the empirical work included in this review, the main locations where the study took place cover Asian (n = 40), Europe (n = 9), Africa (n = 3), Oceania (n = 2), and some research articles contain multiple survey sites. These cases are often involved in temperate climate zones, mediterranean climate zones and tropical desert climate zones. However, the distribution of dots in figure suggests that extreme weather may occur in Russia, central Africa, and North America which are currently less studied. In addition, future climate change is pronounced and covers a wider area while few studied in this database consider the adaptation of vernacular architecture to the future climate variation. Three Asian countries, China, India and Iran, are the top three countries in the number of the studied regions, accounting for 25.46% [11,13,30–40], 10.91% [41–45], and 9.09% [46–50] respectively. They are all related to the Asian region, with a long history and a rich traditional culture. 3.2 The research themes in climate responsiveness Fig. 7 shows the three themes on researches about the relationship between vernacular buildings, climate and human, including 63.64% of the climate responsiveness of vernacular buildings, 16.36% of the adaptive thermal comfort of residents, and 20.00% of the climate adaptability of both buildings and residents. Climate, which is the basis of the research, is the first step in this filed. There are three parts in common climate studies, which are climate data, climate classification by Koeppen-Geiger [29], and climate analysis according to Givoni's psychrometric chart [51], Olgyay's bioclimatic chart [52,53] and Mahoney Table [54]. The researches about climate and people in this field is relatively less. Most of them concentrate on the thermal comfort and thermal adaptive behaviors of human [38], the differences in thermal comfort between urban and rural residents [34], and the field investigation on comfort of residents in different climatic regions [55], etc. The climate responsiveness of vernacular buildings, illustrated in Table 2 , is the main research direction of scholars. This section was divided into two parts by research objects, including the complex factor and the single factor. Most studies’ object is complex factor covering the settlement pattern, building form, courtyard, vegetation and water, semi-open and open space, orientation, internal arrangement, materials of envelope and openings, etc. [2,56,57]. In addition, some studies were conducted with single factor by researchers. For instance, the spaces of vernacular dwelling are the key elements in adjusting thermal environment to adapt climate [11], as the semi-open spaces could improve the indoor thermal environment [58], the underground spaces in hot and arid region could provide a more comfortable condition [43], and except the indoor spaces, living space outside the building is also important [59,60]. Besides, the local materials are a reliable solution for facing severe environment [61,62] and the openings also are essential parts which are relevant to ventilation, daylight, privacy, and aesthetic appeal for houses, such as Mashrabiya in Arab-Islamic architecture [63]. Architecture, as a product of human consciousness and activity, with human beings influenced each other and adapted to the local climate together. A growing number of scholars focused on the complicated relationship between climate, human and architecture. And some also concerned how the vernacular buildings can promote residents to adapt to the climate [11]. In Iran, Spatial organization of dwellings was based on adaptive behavior of residents [45]. Residents changed their places on three-dimensional network to reach the desired convenience, which should be widely promoted. 3.3 The climate responsiveness assessment approaches Typically, a generally complete climate responsiveness assessment should include three topics including climate, human and architecture. And the quantitative and qualitative approaches of them are shown in Fig. 8 . Collecting data is the first step which should contain both climatic and architectural data, and a further analysis of climate data. Secondly, questionnaire study for resident adaptive thermal comfort is selected for the research. Thirdly, two approaches could be used to summary climate responsiveness strategies. Then, based on the strategy results, effectiveness verification needs to be conducted to prove correctness of them. Finally, a systematic analysis aims to discuss the results. As shown in Fig. 8, more and more studies are beginning to focus on the importance of people in climate response research. The quantitative research has moved forward, as the qualitative research is no longer the dominant approach in this field, especially in the field of measurements. However, depending on actual situation and objects of studies, scholars tend to choose some of these elements for research, and the main research methods are shown in Table 3 . The mainstreams of the research approaches are M1 which concern the relationship between climate and dwellings, consistent with the result showing in section 3.2. Besides, as the research techniques evolved, more and more studies are being conducted by using quantitative methods. 3.3.1 The climate responsiveness strategies Most studies summarized the climate responsive strategies of existing dwellings through a qualitative approach combined with building typologies [13,35], which include complex and single factors. In this approach, it is the common consensus that if there is a building design strategy corresponding to at least one climate feature, this strategy is considered adapted to local climate. Similarly, if there is at least one climate strategy in a vernacular dwelling, this house is regarded adapted to the local climate [70]. However, this kind of approach is based on listing, categorizing, and analyzing to summarize the strategies, which mainly relies on the background knowledge of researchers. Especially in the study of complex factors, some contents may be omitted according to the different emphasis. Besides, some studies, using bioclimatic methodology, associated the local climate to climatic strategies. For instance, the Mahoney table methodology is a set of reference tables that classifies the climate data, including the air temperature, relative humidity and precipitation, and gives recommendations for climate-appropriate strategies such as reducing the sun exposure and compacting the building layout [50,56,72]. Givoni's chart predicted the comfort conditions of the indoor environment based on the outdoor climate factor, which contains the comfort zone, marked by a solid line and several zones for passive design strategies [56,65,66]. Although it is a forward process based on climate and neglect other influence factors in actual situation, this approach, from the perspective of climate, could provide evidence and reference for the former. 3.3.2 The quantitative research of the residents’ adaptive thermal comfort Human thermal adaptation is widely recognized to achieve building energy saving [33]. The research methodology for residents’ adaptive thermal comfort is mainly the field survey which contains the thermal environment parameters and the perception of people. The thermal environment parameters include the indoor and outdoor air temperatures, indoor globe temperature, indoor and outdoor relative humidity. The perception of people refers to the thermal sensation, thermal preference, thermal acceptance, thermal adaption behavior, clothing, personal information, etc. [37,55]. In this section, the respondents are randomly selected and the number of samples need large enough to adequately represent the householders in those regions. Then statistical analysis was used to process and analyze the data, showing in Table 4 . 3.3.3 The quantitative validation of climate responsive strategies The evaluation of passive or climate responsive strategies has been settled by using three methods including the numerical calculations/modelling, the small and full-scale experiments, and the field studies [73]. 83.64% of the studies used quantitative research methods. Even so, in the literature sample of this study, the small and full-scale model experiments method was not used. The numerical calculation tools mainly are Energyplus/DesignBuilder, Ecotect, Phoenics, and eQuest (Table 5 ), focusing on the thermal environment and comfort, wind, daylight environment and energy using of buildings. Due to the different functions, some researches would select multiple software [36,70]. However, in recent years, most of the researches are conducted mainly on functional composite software, such as Energyplus or DesignBuilder. Approximately 80% of researches in this study area used field study method mainly in winter and summer [31]. However, there is a lack of research on seasonal transitions. This is understandable, as targeting extreme environmental conditions can help identify problems effectively. In addition, the thermal environment is the most popular topic accounting for 91.30% of the total. There is 52.17% of the field studies focused on the wind environment and 15.22% studied the daylight environment. And most of the researches were done on multiple indoor environment subjects. 3.4 Aggregation of the research findings 3.4.1 The climate strategies for indoor comfort Revisiting the existing researches about climate responsiveness of vernacular dwelling is a path for solutions that promote sustainability. The findings on vernacular dwellings strategies for climate could be summarized in two types. One is to take advantages of the favorable climatic conditions to create a comfortable indoor environment or thermal comfort, the other is to resist unfavorable climatic conditions to maintain the indoor environment or thermal comfort. The climate strategies for indoor comfort were summarized showing in Table 6 [2,35,39,70–72]. The climate strategies and building responses are based on a combination of integrated climatic and terrain conditions [35], functional and aesthetic requirements. Except the vernacular dwellings strategies, people also improve the thermal comfort by their own means, such as adding clothes [55], opening windows, adjusting one's activity position at different times [32]. 3.4.2 The classification of climate strategies A conclusion could be drawn that there are complicated relationships among different climatic strategies. In this context, assessing their relationships and categorizing them could help to understand climate strategies deeply and provide guidelines for subsequent building designers. There have been some mature researches in this section (see Table 7). Different passive strategies must be coordinated to suit different seasons [2]. Thus, scholars categorized climate strategies by the season in which they took effect. In response to common characteristic feature of hot summer and cold winter area, the function of climate strategy is to cool building in summer and heat it in winter. Furthermore, buffer effect which created by passive elements composed of doors, windows, walls etc. and passive spaces like patios, corridors can effectively regulate the indoor environment [36]. This system is classified by targeting architectural elements. Although it is based on the Chinese traditional dwelling, the classifications method is universal and could be learned from. Additionally, scholars also addressed the real location and relationship of each climate strategy, and classified the spatial constituents according to the arrangement of air temperature differences around the dwellings [44]. Different locations of the strategies work together to create a comfortable indoor environment. 4 Discussion The research methodology in this paper is highly depended on the keywords and the selection of appropriate articles. Our research team tried to refine our selection and retrieval process as much as possible. However, it is still possible to overlook a portion of research sample, especially the researches related to climate and vernacular dwellings but does not include the words with similar search terms like “climate response” or “bioclimatic”. We hope we could extend the keyword list and study this field in depth in further study. 4.1 Limitations of the current climate strategies research In this sub-section, we identified three issues of research in current vernacular dwelling climate strategies, which may impede further study. (1) Some of the climate strategies are described in terms of one or a few vernacular dwellings, lacking of a general study of the selected cases. As a result, the selected cases may not fully represent for the region's characteristics. (2) Considering the limitations of the field surveys, there are not enough data to cover 365 days per year, as most studies only chose short-term testing. In fact, a long-term testing or a continuous testing should be promoted for the accurate simulation data. As summer and winter are the most studied time of year, it is recommended that future research may focus on other seasons, especially transition season. (3) As most of the vernacular buildings are located in rural areas, there is a lack of accurate year-round weather data in most of the studied areas which could affect the accuracy of the simulation. 4.2 The research gap of climate responsiveness Following the reference article reviews and current problems, we identified three limitations of this field. (1) The influence of altitude on temperature is significant. Different altitudes have different types of climatic characteristics, and there is still a lack of information on the mechanism of altitude and climate on residential houses. (2) Most of the existing studies are focused on a specific climatic condition, lacking a more macroscopic classification and mapping in different climate zones, which may lead to incomplete research in this field. (3) The two design approaches, which are the Forward Design and Reverse Design respectively represent the design strategy from climate analysis to architecture and the design strategy from traditional vernacular wisdom to architecture, should be evaluated. The two design approaches can complement each other under the requirement of low energy consumption and high comfort. However, it is not rigorous to only focus on whether the strategies of ancient wisdom or the strategies provided by bioclimatic charts. And as the former researchers completely ignored the factor of climate change, our dilemma should be whether the current strategy can be adapted to the future climate. Except the limitations mentioned above, there is one more problem about climate response studies. That is the building climate strategies sometimes cannot fully meet the needs of people, but still need other biological heating, active facilities. As a result, as the climate strategies could not solve the problem completely, some vernacular buildings that are not comfortable enough should be further modified to meet people's indoor environmental needs. 5 Conclusion Climate responsiveness research is the basis and inspiration for low energy consumption and high comfort design for new dwellings’ constructions. This research presents a review of 55 previous studies since 2010 about the vernacular dwelling climate responsiveness. Our research team found that “dwelling”, “performance”, “simulation”, “survey” “vernacular architecture” is the most frequently mentioned keywords, and “adaptive thermal comfort”, “resident”, “outdoor temperature”, “field investigation/measurement” is hot topics in recent years. To further illustrate, a detailed study was conducted based on further classification from architectural perspective. And major valuable conclusions are as follows: (1) Through detailed data analysis, the current mainstream direction and research methods in this research field are summarized: ● In the sample of this studies, relationship between vernacular dwellings and climate is the main body of the researches, accounting for about 63.64% of the total. And the relationship between climate, dwellings and people is less studied at about 20.00%. However, this is a comprehensive solution that is gradually being widely promoted. ● Approximately 83.64% of the studies used quantitative research methods which include field and simulation study. To further illustrate, 80.00% studies in this review used field research methods with the most researched time of winter or summer. In all simulation articles, 56.00% of them used the functionally composite software Energyplus or DesignBuilder. The quantitative research has become a research trend. (2) The main climate strategies for indoor comfort are temperature, humidity, ventilation and daylighting adjustment. These climate strategies are implemented in landscape and settlement pattern, building typology, envelope, openings, buffer spaces, water and vegetation, etc. However, the climate strategies and building are not a single mapped relationship. The complex relationship between them requires further study and classification. Except building strategies, people also adjust their comfort level through behavior and clothing. (3) Based on the results of this review, several potential directions for the future research in this area were proposed. Firstly, multi-disciplinary cooperation and methodology integration are suggested, especially in the fields of humanities, meteorology, and geography. Secondly, more rigorous testing scheme in field study and meteorological data in simulation study are recommended for quantitative studies. Thirdly, there should be more research scenarios in future, such as the different climate zones and seasons, the comparison of regions under different elevations or landscapes, etc. Finally, exploring whether past climate wisdom or current climate strategies are adequate to address future climate change.
