The building sector consumes a significant amount of energy and produces polluting gas emissions. Therefore, many countries have adopted regulations for energy efficiency. In Colombia, Resolution 0549 of 2015 (R0549-2015) has promoted energy efficiency in buildings based on the integration of measures. However, the measures recommended for residential buildings in the absence of air conditioning may not generate the energy savings required. This study evaluates the impact of the integration of the measures recommended by R0549-2015 in two residential buildings (low-and middle-income) in the Bucaramanga metropolitan area based on energy simulations. The results show significant savings in both cases; however, middle-income buildings do not satisfy the savings requirement. The simulations show that except for natural ventilation, the recommended measures do not have a significant impact on energy consumption. For this reason, the evaluation of the measures required additional analyses of thermal comfort and virtual energy. The comfort assessment revealed that the savings measures significantly improved the indoor environment. The analysis of the thermal comfort energy reveals significant savings concerning fully air-conditioned buildings. The results of the simulation also highlight the impacts of some measures incorporated in the studied buildings, such as lamps and high-efficiency elevators, orientation, and vents in the upper part of the windows. These findings support the relevance of strengthening studies aimed at evaluating the impact of the application of the saving measures recommended by the standard. The methodology followed in this study may be of interest to designers and researchers in the evaluation of energy efficiency measures in residential buildings without air conditioning located in a tropical climate. Keywords Building energy simulation Residential buildings Tropical climate 1 Introduction Buildings are responsible for 35% of total global energy consumption and 38% of global emissions [1,2]. For this reason, the governments of several countries have established normative and regulatory frameworks to improve energy efficiency in buildings [2–5]. These frameworks often include recommendations for energy-saving measures to meet savings requirements. These measures can improve the energy consumption and thermal comfort of buildings. To establish recommendations for energy-saving measures, it is common for the developers of regulations to carry out sensitivity studies at the local level based on representative energy models or archetypes [6,7]. Generally, these archetypes consider the common characteristics of the stock of buildings that they represent. Aspects such as the number of buildings considered and the veracity of the energy models can affect the representativeness of the results and the relevance of the recommended measures [7,8]. Therefore, the evaluation of the integration of energy-saving measures in-stock buildings is of interest for improving standards. A review of the literature reveals several studies that have focused on evaluating the impact of integrating energy-saving measures in buildings located in a tropical climate. Some of the reviewed studies have considered the framework of energy regulation. Studies seeking to reduce the thermal load in residential buildings are frequent [9–17]. However, most of the studies identified are aimed at analysing the impact of measures on high-rise residential buildings that include air-conditioning systems [9–11,18]. Some studies have focused on residential buildings without artificial air-conditioning systems. For example, Tong et al. [19] evaluated the impact of energy-saving measures related to façades on comfort and cooling loads in a residential building located in a warm tropical climate. The results obtained for five scenarios show that the window-wall ratio (WWR), natural ventilation, and glass with the best solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) have a high influence on the comfort conditions in the building. Liping and Hien [20] also studied various WWR configurations and window openings in homes, which allowed them to determine that the use of open windows and a WWR of 0.24 enhance natural ventilation and, in turn, significantly improve comfort conditions. Pellegrino et al. [21] demonstrated a significant improvement in the thermal comfort of occupants as a result of the integration of passive measures such as efficient glass, cover with a clear finish, and natural ventilation. Nadji et al. [22] studied natural lighting as a savings and comfort strategy for multi-family residential buildings in Algeria. They studied the effect of strategies such as window size and location and the presence of obstructions on comfort levels. The results show the importance of architectural design for visual comfort and lighting consumption during daylight hours. Some studies have analysed the energy impact and thermal comfort of the measures recommended by national regulations on residential buildings located in a tropical climate. For example, Dhaka et al. [18] studied the impact of integrating a group of energy-efficiency measures recommended by local legislation in a typical residential building located in India. The authors found improvements in the building's thermal comfort conditions because of measures such as a roof with a clear finish, walls with insulating properties, improvement in the U-value of the roof and exterior walls, and the SHCG value of the glass. Conversely, also in India, Kumar et al. [11] studied the impacts of local energy regulation on the energy performance of residential buildings of typical height. According to the results, the components of the envelope, such as the thermal transmittance of walls and windows, have a significant influence on the energy consumption and thermal comfort of the building occupants. In Colombia, Resolution 0549 of 2015 (R0549-2015) recommended a group of energy-saving measures [23], from which the builder can achieve the minimum savings percentages established in the regulation. Fig. 1 shows the compliance scheme for this resolution. In terms of scope, R0549-2015 is mandatory for new buildings belonging to the types of housing (middle- and high-income), shopping centres, offices, hotels, schools, and hospitals located in four climatic zones: cold, hot-dry, hot-humid, and mild. Table 1 presents a description of the climatic conditions in each zone. This applies voluntarily to low-income residential and social housing buildings. R0549-2015 establishes a minimum percentage of energy savings to regulate the energy performance of buildings. The percentage associated with each building is defined according to the type of climate and building type. Compliance with the minimum percentage of savings can be demonstrated by the builder using two methods: i) integration of measures recommended by the resolution according to a group of tables organised by type of climate and typology (prescriptive method), or ii) estimating the percentage of savings associated with the integration of energy efficiency measures in the building (simulations) from the comparison of its performance indicator [kWh/m2∙year] with a base indicator provided by the resolution according to the type of building and the climatic zone in which it is located (performance method). To verify compliance with the resolution, the builder must attach, at the time of receiving the endorsement for the start of work, the self-declaration of compliance issued by the electrical designer (active measures) and signed architectural design plans (passive measures) [23,24]. Similar to other energy standards applicable to buildings, the energy-saving measures (active and passive) recommended by R0549-2015 are the result of a parametric analysis based on representative models. This analysis considers archetypes built from the common characteristics of a small group of buildings of various types located in various cities in the country. The selection of the recommended measures considered construction costs, payback period, and availability of technology in the country. As a result, the standard presents an implementation matrix and tables of recommended measurements for each type of building and climate (Tables 16–19 of Annex 1 of R0549-2015) [24]. For non-residential buildings (e.g. hotels, offices, and hospitals), R0549-2015 recommends passive measures related to the envelope and active measures related to the efficiency of the main building systems. This makes sense when considering that lighting and air conditioning account for approximately 30% and 60% of the total energy consumption, respectively; equipment represents the remaining 10% [25,26]. For residential buildings, the measures recommended by the resolution are mostly passive. However, such measures may have a limited impact on energy consumption because the presence of an air conditioning system in these types of buildings is uncommon [27,28]. Note that some countries with a tropical climate and current energy regulations have carried out studies to evaluate their impacts on the energy performance of residential buildings. This is the case in Brazil, where studies have addressed the validation and improvement of the robustness of the energy evaluation system for buildings proposed by the national government [29–31]. In India, studies have evaluated the impact of the integration of a group of energy efficiency measures recommended by local regulations in typical residential buildings [18] or high-rise residential buildings [11]. Currently, Colombia presents little evidence for the development of this type of study. However, some studies have investigated the potential of energy-saving strategies, as well as the energy and thermal characteristics of buildings. Arias et al. [32] estimated the global energy savings associated with the strategies recommended by R0549-2015 for Colombian cities. The results show savings between 8% and 12% for cities with better compliance with resolutions. Ortíz et al. [33] carried out a study of the global warming potential associated with the energy consumption of a house located in a cold climate. The results reveal that appliances and lighting have the highest impact. Nieves et al. [34] characterised and projected the energy demand for various sectors, including residential sectors. The results of the characterisation showed that energy consumption in homes is associated with food refrigeration (30.8%), thermal conditioning (25.2%), lighting (13.9%), heat generation for cooking (12.3%y6), and others (17.8%). Osma et al. [27] and Cárdenas et al. [35] conducted studies on the energy and thermal performance of two low-income residential buildings. The results show an energy consumption close to 30 kWh/m2∙year, a value 13% lower than the base indicator proposed by R0549-2015. The thermal discomfort conditions are common most of the year due to solar irradiation. Likewise, Medina et al. [36] reviewed studies evaluating thermal comfort in buildings in Colombia. The results of the review demonstrate the difficulty in evaluating the thermal comfort requirements associated with the implementation of the passive measures recommended by R0549-2015. The review found comfort deficiencies in most cases considered, especially in low-income housing. As mentioned, R0549-2015 recommends energy-saving measures to meet the minimum energy-saving requirements. However, it is not clear whether the recommended measures are effective for low- and middle-income residential buildings within the stock, as they generally do not have air-conditioning systems. Additionally, although there are studies in the literature that evaluate the impact of saving measures in residential buildings, they are not very specific and do not present a detailed evaluation of the impact on the energy-saving and comfort of these measures in buildings with characteristics similar to those of buildings typically built in various areas of the country, such as the Bucaramanga Metropolitan Area (BMA). Considering the above, this work seeks to analyse compliance with the regulatory provisions applicable to residential buildings with low or zero use of artificial air-conditioning systems, belonging to the socioeconomic categories of middle- and low-income in the BMA. As a result, this study makes it possible to show the impact of the measures recommended by R0549-2015 in building categories with the greatest dynamism at the national level [37], which could help in the identification of recommendations for improvement to be taken into account by local designers, builders, and government entities to achieve more energy-efficient buildings. This study evaluates the impact of the measures recommended by R0549-2015 in two energy-modelled residential-type buildings (low- and middle-income buildings) (Section 2). The results individually describe the energy performance and the indoor thermal comfort conditions associated with the measures recommended by the national energy regulation and configurations such as a WWR of 30%, a reflective roof, and the absence of ventilation openings in the case of low-income buildings, as well as the impact on energy consumption of photovoltaic (PV) energy generation (Section 3). Finally, the results of the analysis allow the establishment of conclusions related to compliance with the regulation and design of residential buildings in the low- and middle-income categories located in a hot, dry climate (Section 4). 2 Methodology This study consisted of four stages, as shown in Fig. 2 : description of the buildings under study (Section 2.1), energy modelling (Section 2.2), the establishment of the simulation plan (Section 2.3), and definition of the parameters for the analysis of energy performance and thermal comfort (Section 2.4). 2.1 Description of the buildings understudy A group of experts determined the representativeness of the buildings under study concerning stock [38]. This study considered two types of buildings located in the BMA: middle-income residential buildings and low-income residential buildings. The BMA is located at 7.13° north and 73.13° west. Its average solar irradiation is 4.8 kWh/m2∙day, although it varies between 2.0 and 7.6 kWh/m2∙day. The city has a warm climate and an altitude of 960 m above sea level (masl). Table 2 presents the general climate data for this tropical city [39–42]. The representative building in the middle-income residential category (RBMIC) is a 12-story building. Each floor has six apartments, with an approximate area of 62 m2. In the case of the low-income residential category (RBLIC), the representative building has seven floors distributed as follows: six floors with six apartments each, and a semi-underground floor with four apartments. All the apartments have an area of approximately 45 m2. The building has no parking spaces inside. Table 3 presents the most relevant characteristics of each building. The buildings under study do not have domestic hot-water systems. In Colombia, no regulation requires this type of system in residential buildings; therefore, its implementation occurs voluntarily in high-income residential buildings. Regarding energy efficiency, the buildings included some measures of note. The two buildings have facades with glazed areas oriented primarily towards the south and a WWR of less than 20%, which reduces the direct capture of solar irradiance on the envelope. In both buildings, users installed LED lamps in their apartments and used natural ventilation in most of the spaces. In addition, the RBMIC includes energy-saving elevators in its design. 2.2 Energy modelling The use of the DesignBuilder V6 tool allowed us to carry out energy modelling of buildings. This software is an interface for the EnergyPlus simulation engine used in various studies [19,43,44]. The architectural design information collected through floor plans and details served as input for the construction of the geometric model and the definition of the materials. Electrical designs and inspection visits provided data on electrical loads and building usage, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the energy models of the two buildings. A calibration process can improve the reliability of the energy models. According to the literature, the calibration of energy models significantly improves the accuracy of the simulation results and is usually performed using energy consumption data obtained by bills or monitoring processes developed over long intervals (greater than one month) or short intervals (less than one month) [45–47]. It is also common to use indoor environment variables, such as relative humidity and indoor air temperature [48]. The energy models of the buildings were adjusted according to the methodology of Cárdenas-Rangel et al. [49]. The local energy trading company provided the measured values of annual energy consumption. The process for adjusting habitable areas (apartments) considered the percentage error between the measured and simulated annual energy consumption. The estimation error E a d j is calculated using Eq. (1), where A E C s i m is the simulated annual energy consumption for apartment type n (kWh/year) and A E C m e a is the measured annual energy consumption for apartment type n (kWh/year). Eq. (1) E a d j = A E C m e a − A E C s i m A E C s i m 100 % The energy model of the archetype is satisfactory when E a d j is less than 10% in at least 90% of the apartment types in the building. Measured energy consumption data for the common areas were not available. For this reason, the adjustment of the common areas considered data on the tuned use of lighting and motors in modelling exercises with buildings of similar characteristics. Table 4 summarises the adjustment processes of the energy models. The adjustment of the RMLIC required the definition of a comparison typology, as well as the realisation of a simulation. In contrast, given the presence of air conditioning, the RBMIC adjustment required eight types of comparisons. After the calibration process, the representative energy model of the RBLIC did not exceed an error of 5%. The RBMIC case required two additional iterations to adjust the air-conditioned areas. The error for this building was less than 2%. Therefore, these energy models are valid for the proposed analysis. 2.3 Definition of the simulation plan The study of compliance with the requirements of R0549-2015 in two residential buildings considered several energy simulations. The simulation plan considered the energy performance and thermal comfort of the buildings under eight scenarios: the current design conditions or real case (Re.), representative attributes of the stock or reference case (Ref.), and six scenarios considering the integration of energy efficiency measures (cases of integration of measures). The real case corresponds to the simulation of the energy models described in Section 2.2 of this paper. The reference building was a real building without any saving measures. The reference building had the same geometric characteristics as the real case. However, it adopted a group of attributes that are considered representative of the stock of the related type. Table 5 presents the attributes adopted for the reference buildings related to orientation, use, materials, and loads. These are part of the results of a characterisation conducted within the framework of a local project [38]. The integration scenarios for energy efficiency measures considered the measures recommended by R0549-2015 (Table 18 from the Sustainable Construction Guide for Saving Water and Energy in Buildings): horizontal shading (Shad) and natural ventilation (NVent). The analysis also considered a set of the window-wall ratio of 30% (WWR), the value recommended by the resolution. In the case of the RBLIC, the analysis additionally considered the roof measure with a light finish (RPaint) and the configuration of the absence of ventilation openings over the windows (NVentO). This study also included the integration of PV solar energy systems as a strategy to reduce energy consumption from the electrical grid. Dimensioning of the capacity of PV systems considers the maximum consumption associated with general services. For the RBMIC, the installed capacity of the photovoltaic generation system is 9.2 kWp, whereas, it is 0.6 kWp for the RBLIC; this capacity is significantly lower than that of the RBMIC because its consumption is mostly associated with a lighting system. The analysis of the simulation results considers the description of the energy consumption and thermal comfort of the buildings under study. The evaluation of energy behaviour considers variables such as annual energy consumption (Aec), breakdown of annual energy consumption (Baec), and indicators of the intensity of energy use (Iieu). The study of thermal comfort applies variables such as hours of discomfort (hdc) and the predicted mean vote index (PMV). PMV expresses the mean value of the subjective sensation of comfort of a group of people in a given environment [50,51]. Its analysis involves the monthly averages in all spaces of a building in an interval of one year. Additionally, to delve into the impact of the integration of passive measures in non-air-conditioned residential buildings, the simulations considered the calculation of Thermal Comfort Energy (TCE), corresponding to the energy required to satisfy the conditions of interior thermal comfort due to the integration of the energy efficiency measures under study. The calculation of the TCE considered the types of climates defined by R0549-2015 (Hot-humid (HH), Hot-dry (HD), Mild (M), and Cold (C)), the selection of a standard air conditioning system, and the configuration of its operation in the buildings under study. The selection of the standard air conditioning system for the calculation of TCE adopted the recommendations of the baseline air conditioning systems of Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1 of 2019. The representative energy models of the buildings under study were configured with PTHP and PTAC type air conditioning systems depending on the climate. Each of these systems integrates heating and cooling components. The cooling and heating setpoint temperatures are 24 °C and 20 °C, respectively. The calculation of the TCE associated with natural ventilation required the use of the mixed-mode simulation option. This allows to automatically alternate the operation of the natural ventilation and the air conditioning system. The simulation plan consisted of 44 energy and thermal comfort simulations, as shown in Table 6 , with 11 for the RBMIC and 33 for the RBLIC. The two additional RBLIC simulations correspond to thermal comfort simulations for roof strategies with a light finish and a real building without grating. 2.4 Analysis of energy performance and thermal comfort The analysis of the results consists of 4 parts. In the first place, the authors addressed the analysis of the current state of the buildings under study to identify the design characteristics that generate energy savings for traditional construction (reference building) and the baseline indicator of R0549-2015. The current status analysis also considered outcomes such as total annual energy consumption, energy uses, and thermal comfort. Second, this work includes the evaluation of the impact on energy consumption of a group of energy efficiency measures, which is based on the comparison of the energy use intensity indicators associated with the measures integration scenarios for the baseline indicator of R0549-2015 and the indicator obtained in the reference case. Third, the energy efficiency measures recommended by the resolution for residential buildings are mostly passive. For this reason, the authors quantified their impact on the thermal comfort and the virtual air conditioning energy required to satisfy the thermal comfort conditions in non-air-conditioned buildings (TCE). The results were obtained for the four climatic zones established by R0549-2015. The TCE made it possible to demonstrate the potential impact of passive energy efficiency measures on typical residential buildings in a tropical climate. Finally, considering the increase in the penetration of photovoltaic systems in residential buildings, the authors studied the impact of the integration of photovoltaic generation. The results seek to highlight the benefits of installing PV systems in reducing consumption in common-use areas. 3 Results This section presents the main findings of the energy simulation of buildings on the integration of energy-saving measures recommended by R0549-2015. First, the characteristics of the energy behaviour and thermal comfort of the current state (Section 3.1) and the impact on energy consumption (Section 3.2) and thermal comfort (Section 3.3) resulting from the integration of strategies recommended by the resolution are presented, as well as other typical configurations whose impact is important to address. Finally, the impact of the integration of PV systems on energy consumption is analysed (Section 3.4), and a discussion of this study is presented (Section 3.5). 3.1 Actual building analysis Table 7 presents the energy consumption results for the real case as well as the energy savings associated with each building considering the baseline indicators of R0549-2015. The table shows the energy savings for the resolution baseline of 17% and 44% for the real RBMIC and RBLIC scenarios, respectively. The energy savings presented by the real case of the RBMIC were not sufficient to meet the 25% savings requirement established by the resolution. In the case of the RBLIC, the opposite is true, as the achieved energy savings largely satisfy the 20% requirement. Fig. 4 presents a comparison of the energy consumption breakdowns for the buildings analysed considering the real and reference scenarios. Accordingly, the energy savings present in the RBMIC are caused by a reduction in lighting and equipment consumption. Lighting consumption shows a decrease of approximately 64% and 49% in apartments and common areas, respectively, as a result of the use of energy-saving lamps. However, the consumption of equipment shows a reduction of 35%, especially regarding the consumption of motors. This behaviour is due to the inclusion of high-efficiency elevators. In the case of the RBLIC, energy savings occur because of the reduction in lighting consumption as well as the absence of air-conditioning systems and motors. The reduction in lighting consumption is approximately 79% and 42% in the apartments and common areas, respectively. To evaluate the comfort conditions inside the buildings, an analysis was conducted to evaluate the thermal comfort using the adaptive comfort method proposed by ASHRAE 55 in 2020. This method allows the evaluation of thermal comfort from the estimate of a comfort range that considers the monthly average dry-bulb temperature and hourly values of the operating temperature [51]. The results show a total of 1439 h of thermal discomfort (16.43% of the time during the year). In all cases, the discomfort is due to hot conditions. Similarly, the RBMIC presented 1450 h of discomfort (16.55% of the year). Again, all hours of discomfort occurred because of heat. Concerning the interior spaces of the buildings, the worst comfort conditions for the RBLIC occurred in apartments in contact with the roof. These spaces present an average of 3185 h of thermal discomfort per year. The same situation occurs for the RBMIC. In this case, the spaces in contact with the roof show an average of 2833 h of discomfort per year. However, the conditioned spaces present a significant improvement in comfort conditions. In this case, the results show 331 h of discomfort. Another result considered for the evaluation of thermal comfort is the Fanger PMV index [50,51]. Fig. 5 presents the monthly behaviour of this index for a period of one year in both the RBLIC and RBMIC. The PMV simulation results suggest a less comfortable thermal environment for the RBLIC. The thermal sensation inside the spaces of this building ranges between slightly hot and warm. The most favourable PMV values occur between April and September, which is usually the period with the highest rainfall. In the case of the RBMIC, Fanger's PMV results reveal a neutral to slightly warm thermal sensation for most of the year. This behaviour occurs because of the presence of air-conditioning systems in the main rooms of some apartments. 3.2 Analysis of the impact on energy saving Table 8 presents the energy consumption values associated with the various RBMIC and RBLIC simulation configurations. Among the configurations considered for RBMIC are the real case, reference case, integration of the saving measures recommended by the prescriptive method of R0549-2015 (natural ventilation and horizontal shading), and WWR configuration recommended in the resolution [42]. Regarding the base indicator of the resolution, the case with the greatest savings potential is associated with the natural ventilation strategy. In this case, the value of the energy savings exceeds the minimum requirement for savings established by the regulations by approximately 11%. As previously mentioned, the savings for the real case (MI-Re.) are primarily associated with efficient lighting and motors (elevators). However, some architectural design parameters, such as orientation, benefit a building's energy performance. The current building has the largest glazed area facing the south. Therefore, the sun falls primarily on the unglazed walls of the building. Horizontal shading settings and a 30% WWR offer no additional savings compared with the base case. This is because building air-conditioning systems are mostly used at night. The reference scenario (MI-Reference) presents a slightly higher energy consumption for the base indicator. This is because of the use of conventional lamps and motors. In the case of the RBLIC, the energy consumption results are similar for all configurations analysed. In all cases, the savings largely satisfy the minimum requirement imposed by the resolution for this type of building. Note that settings such as shading on exterior windows, setting the WWR at 30%, and natural ventilation do not present additional energy savings compared with the real case. The energy savings in the real case of this building, in addition to being due to the use of efficient lighting systems, are associated with design characteristics such as an adequate orientation that mitigates solar gains and the provision of openings in the form of grids located at the top of the windows. However, this may also be associated with the inability of the baseline indicator to reflect the reference energy consumption of the stock. Therefore, it would be relatively easy for buildings in the BMA to meet the minimum savings requirements. The simulation results show energy savings concerning the reference building and the baseline of R0549-2015. However, these savings are mostly associated with active energy efficiency measures. Only natural ventilation generates savings by not using air conditioning systems. The results shown so far do not show the impact of the energy efficiency measures recommended by local regulations. For this reason, the authors considered studying this impact through analysis of thermal comfort and the virtual energy required to satisfy thermal comfort, as shown in sections 3.3 and 3.4. 3.3 Analysis of the impact on thermal comfort The evaluation of the impact of the measures recommended by the prescriptive method of R0549-2015 on thermal comfort for the RBMIC and RBLIC considers the results of hours of thermal discomfort and the PMV index. Fig. 6 shows the PMV values for the various simulation configurations for the RBMIC and RBLIC. The average results of all the configurations analysed for the RBMIC revealed neutral to slightly warm thermal conditions between April and September and slightly warm to warm thermal conditions for the rest of the year. The inclusion of horizontal shading in exterior windows improved the monthly average PMV values by between 4% and 11%. In the case of natural ventilation, the results showed an increase between 7% and 17% of the average PMV values. Such behaviour occurs because of the total absence of air-conditioning systems under this configuration. The average PMV results for all configurations analysed for the RBLIC reveal a thermal environment between slightly hot and hot. The analysis considered two additional configurations for this building: a reflective roof and windows without ventilation openings. The reflective roof generates a reduction between 10% and 20% in the PMV values for the average of all measures considered. This allows us to infer that the spaces in contact with the roof are decisive when establishing the thermal comfort of the building. The configuration without ventilation openings shows a decrease in the monthly PMV values of approximately 22% in the real case. The 30% WWR setting presents thermal discomfort values between 11% and 20% above the average monthly PMV values. This is due to the increase in glazing areas in the real case. Fig. 7 presents the hours of discomfort for the various configurations tested in the RBMIC and RBLIC. For the horizontal shading strategy, the results show a total of 937 h of discomfort per year, the fewest of all the configurations analysed. In the case of natural ventilation, the number of hours of discomfort amounts to 2115, which is 31% higher than that found for the real configuration. For the RBLIC, the results reveal comfort conditions that are favourable for the reflective roof configuration. Only 5% of the hours of the year experienced thermal discomfort. Natural ventilation has several important benefits. In this study, the percentage of hours of discomfort was 16%. By increasing the WWR to 30%, this value increased to 52% because of the increase in thermal gains caused by solar radiation on the exterior windows. The louvres arranged in the upper part of the windows generated a reduction of approximately 62% in the hours of thermal discomfort compared with the case without the louvres. These results confirm the importance of this configuration in regulating the interior thermal comfort of low-income residential buildings in hot, dry climates. 3.4 Analysis of the thermal comfort energy The analysis of thermal comfort energy only considered the RBLIC. This energy model presents a total absence of air conditioning equipment and integrates the largest number of energy efficiency measures. Fig. 8 presents the TEC results for various measures integration scenarios considered for the RBLIC. In all cases, the simulations under Hot-humid climate conditions show the highest thermal comfort energy requirements, this occurs due to the severity of the climatic conditions and their influence on the elements of the building. Under Hot-humid weather conditions guaranteeing thermal comfort is difficult. The energy values for comfort in Hot-humid, Hot-dry, and mild climates are associated with cooling needs. Only in cold weather does heating maintain comfortable conditions. Natural ventilation presents the best benefit to improve comfort conditions in the interior spaces of the building. Energy Efficiency measures such as setting the WWR at 30% and the use of a reflective roof can increase TEC due to the deterioration of comfort conditions, mainly for temperate and cold climates. Table 9 presents the savings percentages of each energy efficiency measure concerning the Real case (without passive strategies) and the baseline indicator, considering the climates defined by the resolution. The savings results for the real scenario again reveal natural ventilation as the energy efficiency measure with the greatest potential. That measure reduces the energy consumption by 22.5% relative to the base case. The simulations under Hot-humid climate conditions present savings that, on average, amount to a value of 14.8%. For Mild weather, the reflective finish cover offers a big savings potential. Under this configuration, the TCE value is reduced by 34.5% compared to the Real case. Some measures can produce overconsumption of TCE, such as the case of the reflective roof in cold weather and the increase in WWR for Mild weather. This occurs because they favour heat losses and gains, respectively. The comparison between the energy use intensity indicators of the configurations studied concerning the baseline indicators showed that only under mild weather conditions are the savings requirements defined by R0549-2015 met. The mild weather offers the best outdoor conditions that favour obtaining thermal comfort. 3.5 Analysis of the impact of the integration of photovoltaic solar energy The energy impact of the integration of PV solar energy was also considered. Fig. 9 shows the annual behaviour of the energy generated by the PV systems and the energy consumption in common areas for the buildings under study. For the RBLIC, the monthly consumption values in common areas exceed on average 11% of the energy values generated by the PV panels. In December, the differences between the PV energy generated and consumed by the common areas are at a maximum of approximately 19%. In contrast, in January, the smallest differences are near 3%. The PV system annually produces 2.27% of the total energy consumption and 90% of the total consumption of the common areas. For the RBMIC, the energy generated by the PV system represents approximately 13.4% of the total energy consumption of the building and satisfies the energy requirements of common areas. 3.6 Discussion According to the literature, studies carried out to evaluate the impact of the integration of the saving measures recommended in R0549-2015 represent a prospective and global approach [32]. This approach differs from the detailed analysis of buildings carried out in this study, which made it possible to quantify both the global savings achieved by the set of strategies and the energy savings caused by each strategy. As in other energy characterisation studies of buildings [27,35], the normalised annual energy consumption was below the reference indicators of the resolution. This study estimates energy savings of at least 17%, particularly because of the integration of strategies such as efficient equipment and lighting. In terms of thermal comfort, the results based on the PMV analysis for low-income buildings agree with the results previously obtained in [27,35], and [36]. Simulations revealed that the indoor environments are slightly warm and hot. This study provides evidence for the existence of thermal discomfort (number of hours), as in previous reports ([27,35,36]), and identifies the WWR at 30% and the absence of natural ventilation as aggravating causes of such discomfort. The results of the evaluation of the impact on energy-saving show that the application of R0549-2015 does not achieve a significant impact on the reduction of energy consumption in residential buildings in the absence of artificial air conditioning systems, unless complementary instruments such as analysis of thermal comfort and thermal comfort energy, as this study shows. The methodology followed in this work may be useful for other researchers in the evaluation of passive-type measures integrated into non-air-conditioned projects located in tropical climates and the evaluation of the impact of new local regulations focused on the energy efficiency of buildings. 4 Conclusions The analysis of compliance with R0549-2015 shows that for the RBMIC to comply with the minimum energy-saving requirement required by R0549-2015, the building should integrate additional saving measures. However, the simulations revealed a significant savings percentage from the integration of measures such as efficient lamps and motors. On the contrary, the RBLIC achieves energy savings much higher than the minimum required by the resolution. In this case, energy savings occur because of the absence of air conditioners and motors and the integration of saving measures, such as the use of natural ventilation through windows and grilles, and the use of low-consumption lamps. Evaluation of the thermal comfort according to the ASHRAE 55 standard of 2020 revealed similar comfort conditions for the two buildings considered in the analysis. In both cases, thermal discomfort occurred for approximately 17% of the year. The greatest thermal discomfort occurred in spaces in contact with the roof. Analysis of the integration of measures showed that compliance with R0549-2015 in non-air-conditioned residential buildings requires additional measures to those recommended by the standard, especially those focused on reducing the consumption of electrical appliances, motors, and lighting. Measures such as natural ventilation have the greatest impact on saving energy and improving thermal comfort conditions. In the case of the RBLIC, the absence of air-conditioning systems makes it relatively easy to meet the energy-saving requirements of R0549-2015. However, the results of the simulations suggest considering thermal comfort and thermal comfort energy as a parameter for evaluating the effectiveness of the measures to be integrated into each case. In this way, the occupants of buildings will not need to use energy to achieve thermal comfort. The results of the thermal comfort energy analysis reveal significant energy savings associated with all the measures considered. However, the climate influences the magnitude of these savings. Exterior environmental conditions are a determinant of the building's energy performance and an indication of the level of effort to be made in the design process. Following the results presented in this work, the entity responsible for R0549-2015 should review the recommended measures for low- and medium-income residential buildings, as well as the baseline indicators. Although the methodology followed to estimate the indicators is clear, improving the accuracy of the indicators requires the consideration of a greater number of buildings in each of the categories contemplated by the regulations, as well as the collection of a large amount of energy consumption data. The current reference values may not be representative of the stock, which could lead to the erroneous evaluation of buildings. The proposed methodology to evaluate the relevance of the saving measures recommended in the local regulations can be replicated to carry out similar studies in tropical climates, given the deficiency of work related to the energy evaluation of non-air-conditioned residential buildings under these climatic conditions.
