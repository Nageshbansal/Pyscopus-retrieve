The importance of climate change mitigation and energy efficiency as a growing global concern has intensified the development of techniques to reach and improve thermal comfort and energy efficiency of buildings. The study of the effect of the height of the openings on the internal natural airflow in one-story buildings can be found in many studies; However, studies on the effect of this important factor on providing thermal comfort in high-rise buildings equipped with DSF are not available. This paper focuses on natural-ventilated buildings based on wind-driven and buoyancy-driven forces. The aim of this study is to use passive strategies in high-rise office buildings in hot and dry climates. In this research, two methods of field studies and numerical modeling have been used in order to provide accurate results. In order to achieve optimal patterns in the design of natural-ventilated buildings; CFD simulation and PMV thermal comfort index have been used in the evaluation of various configurations. The results of the present study show that although the cooling energy demand in high-rise buildings in hot climates is high and the use of natural ventilation systems is beneficial, but these systems alone are not able to provide thermal comfort conditions. However, the accurate and correct location of the openings is effective in improving thermal comfort by increasing the volume flow. Keywords Cross-ventilation High-rise building Opening position Thermal comfort Double-skin façade CFD 1 Introduction The structure of the urban environments and their morphology is effective in improving human comfort in indoor and outdoor spaces [1,2]. On the other hand, the role of the building sector as a micro-climatic reformer [3] and to achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement to reduce global warming [4] (IEA, 2008) is significant. Therefore, the use of renewable energy, sustainable buildings [5,6], and balancing different parameters in indoor spaces are simple and efficient methods. Assessing the effects of geometric features, physical and ambient air conditions on a system operation, and the capability of the system to meet thermal comfort conditions is of great importance [7]. Adaptation of these parameters is largely achieved by using passive strategies and mechanical ventilation systems as a solution to guarantee air exchange in residential energy retrofit [8]. Therefore, one of the most important of these strategies is the optimization and use of cross natural ventilation (CNV) and double-skin façade (DSF) systems. A detailed review of the literature indicates that mechanical ventilation systems and HVAC account for 30–60% of the total energy of modern buildings [9,10] and 68% of the total energy of large buildings [11]. Energy consumption in a naturally ventilated building is typically 30–40% less than in a building equipped with air conditioning [12–14]. A ventilation system is designed not only to save energy but also to avoid risks to occupants' health [15]. Natural ventilation systems with glazed façades, in addition to using daylight and reducing energy consumption, help to overcome the common problems related to the maintenance of HVAC systems [16]. Therefore, nowadays a lot of attention has been paid to the design of natural ventilation systems in buildings [17]. Natural cross-ventilation is a method commonly used to achieve comfort, ventilative cooling, and eliminate pollutants in indoor spaces [18–24]. In addition, it can be used as a passive cooling method to reduce the cooling demand in buildings [25–27]; because today, indoor thermal comfort is significantly achieved by using air-conditioners [27–30] which results in increased energy consumption and negative environmental effects [31]. Albeit cross-ventilation flow in buildings is dominantly impacted by the characteristics of their surrounding built environment [32], improving the performance of natural ventilation systems with the aim of increasing thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption has always been the focus of architects and researchers; In this regard, the study of geometric factors such as the position and dimensions of the openings have an important role [33]. Cross-ventilation is the most effective mode of wind-driven natural ventilation but completely depends on the external openings and internal layout [34]. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) investigation of the effect of the position of window openings on the mechanism of cross natural ventilation has been conducted in numerous studies [35–38]. Wind tunnel experiments on cross-ventilation and the position of openings in an isolated single-storey building with simple square geometry indicate that the lower the opening height, the lower the indoor air velocity [35]. Meroney's study of cross-ventilation by examining five opening configurations showed that the highest and lowest indoor airflow velocities were observed in the “up” (both high on up-and downwind walls) and “up down” (high on the upwind wall and low on the downwind wall) models, respectively [37]. Another study on the opening positions in a square room showed that the positions of the openings in the upper part of the windward wall gain higher airflow velocity while the lowest internal airflow velocity belongs to the openings located near the floor [36]. A study by Zhang et al. displays that two-opening configurations proved to be tremendously efficient for cross-ventilation. Using a larger opening on the windward or leeward surface, the two-opening configuration achieves higher ventilation rates and better indoor wind circulation than both the three- and four-opening configurations [34]. Furthermore, research conducted by Zhiyi et al. proposes establishing a horizontal airflow channel (cross-ventilation channel) in the elevator hall to improve the air exchange rate and increase the effectiveness of natural ventilation [39]. Natural ventilation is not only a useful mechanism for moderating the indoor temperature but also for dispersing pollutants. Surveys display that the performance of cross-ventilation in reducing the pollutant concentration enhances as the height to width ratio of the openings increases [40]. Analyses show that the ventilation behavior depends on the energy standard of the building; thus, there is evidence of an inverse U-shaped correlation between the efficiency of the building and ventilation behavior, and in buildings with a high energy standard, households predominantly ventilate in an energy-efficient manner [41]. Examination of the roof slope angle parameter in evaluating the cross ventilation of a one-story building showed that the airflow rate depends on the roof slope angle; The building with a slope angle of 45°gives better results than other cases, and the airflow rate is 25% higher when the outlet opening is near the ceiling [42]. In addition, practical concerns such as preventing rain, theft, or excessive sunlight should be considered; the use of shutters and louvers in the openings helps a lot in improving the situation. CFD simulation results show that zero-degree louvers have little effect on indoor airflow, and 45-degree louvers reduce the velocity of airflow near the inlet and outlet of the window [43]. However, studies of wind tunnels and computational fluid dynamics in this field in later years showed that louvers with angles of zero, 15, and 30°increase the indoor air velocity in the central part of the building, and louvers with angles of 45°mainly lead to increased air velocity in the areas near the window [44]. Wind tunnel testing and CFD simulation on the position of openings with louver in a one-story building show that the highest volume flow rate in the building is obtained with the up openings, and the highest air exchange efficiency in the building with the central openings [45]. But the important point is that most of this research has focused on the airflow patterns and distribution of pollution in single-storey buildings with simple square geometry [46–51]. Therefore, there is a clear lack of numerical studies on the effect of cross-ventilation systems and physical indicators of windows in high-rise buildings on indoor thermal comfort; because the effect of natural ventilation on the thermal comfort of users indoors is significant [52]. However, a study by Omrani et al. [53] showed that cross-ventilation performs better than single-sided ventilation in achieving indoor thermal comfort. On the other hand, the use of SWV system (smart window-integrated ventilation system) as an aid to the HVAC system was more effective in winter than in summer for improving IAQ and thermal comfort [54]. In another study, the optimization of window configuration and thermal comfort in different climatic regions of China was performed [55]. According to the results of this study, it is difficult to maintain the indoor comfortable environment in all zones at the same time for buildings with large area windows; however, proper windows configuration has a positive effect on improving indoor thermal comfort. Laboratory studies were also performed on the impact of windows on thermal comfort, motion, and cognitive performance, which showed the positive effect of windows [56]. Meanwhile, the study of the effect of windows on indoor thermal comfort requires further consideration of the parameters because the achievement and presentation of optimal patterns in this field have not been well solved yet. Double-skin façade (DSF) technology is also one of the technical strategies to save energy in modern and high-rise buildings such as office buildings [57–60] and improve the thermal performance of the building [61]. In addition to energy efficiency, thermal comfort is an important factor in the double-skin facade [62–64]. The study of thermal comfort in buildings with DSFs affected by different criteria has been done in scant studies [65]. The research projects of the IGS and field studies were conducted on thermal comfort in the single-skin facade (SSF) and double-skin facade (DSF) buildings in Germany. The DSF buildings had less thermal amplitude during the summer and offered better ventilation control, as well as better thermal comfort in wintertime [66]. A similar study found different results by conducting field studies in 280 office rooms of 28 buildings in Germany. In general, the results showed that DSF buildings have fewer advantages than SSF buildings [67]. On the other hand, Kim et al. proved that double-skin facades can be used to maintain the human comfort level of the indoor spaces [68]. The comparison of thermal performance, energy, and comfort of DSFs in Central Europe was also evaluated and showed that DSFs are useful in improving thermal comfort conditions [69]. Alibaba and Ozdeniz also studied the energy consumption and thermal comfort of an office building with SSF and DSF in hot climates using TAS software. According to the results of this study, in hot climates, the DSF provides thermal comfort in winter, but in summer, its positive effects and benefits are slight [70]. The suitability of DSFs in hot climates remains questionable due to the high transparency of the exterior surface and its tendency to overheat during peak outdoor temperatures [71]. Various studies indicate that the transfer of pure heat to the indoor environment can be significantly reduced by installing venetian blinds [72,73], planting plants [66], and using the appropriate materials in the cavity, as well as the production of small-scale wind turbine power for efficient extraction of wind energy around the DSFs [74–78]. However, studies on daylight indicate that the DSFs and shading systems inside the cavity do not conform to daylight strategies and reduce the use of natural light and increase the use of artificial light [79,80], power consumption, building cooling load, and the excess heat generated from lighting sources [81,82]. Simulation and evaluation of 12 office buildings equipped with DSF in different climates using IES VE software showed that the DSFs are not able to provide the indoor lighting standards (75%) [83]. The heat transfer process in DSFs is relatively complex and their physical properties have always been introduced as an important factor [84–90]. Most experimental and numerical studies on improving the efficiency of DSF buildings focus on cavities [73,90–93]. He et al. examined the energy flow through a traditional window using a small scale [94]. However, little research has been done on the reliability of these models in improving the thermal comfort of the room space. Research in this field requires an optimized and developed algorithm that studies different parameters simultaneously [95]. The most important technique for proper ventilation of stagnant hot air in outdoor and indoor spaces is the use of cold airflows; however, the heated surfaces and heat fluxes in these spaces also have an important effect on the flow field and the distribution pattern of pollutants by creating a buoyancy force. Thus, when wind speeds are weak or buoyancy forces more important than inertial forces, thermal effects on the flow regimes are expected to be greatest [96,97]. Nevertheless, thermal processes have been less studied as one of the most important parameters affecting the natural ventilation rate and indoor air temperature; and most research on cross-ventilation in buildings is limited to isothermal conditions. The present study tries to provide more accurate results of the effect of cross-ventilation in high-rise office buildings on thermal comfort indices by examining thermal properties. Simultaneous study of various parameters such as the combination of natural ventilation systems and their physical layout in achieving and improving the thermal comfort of high-rise buildings has not been done in any research. The extensive literature review of the effects of natural ventilation systems in buildings indicates that the majority of available studies are limited to low-rise buildings with simple geometries, and few studies can be found on high-rise buildings. On the other hand, the effects of cross-natural ventilation and DSFs systems as well as their configuration in improving the thermal comfort conditions of high-rise buildings have not been studied. DSF systems significantly reduce the heat energy requirement in cold climates, but overheating and high cooling load are their main disadvantages in hot climates [60]. Therefore, the present paper has examined the impact of the configuration of natural ventilation systems and the positions of inlet and outlet openings on airflow and temperature patterns in indoor spaces in hot and dry climates. Due to the increasing growth of high-rise office buildings and their importance in modern architecture, this study tries to help reduce energy consumption and provide thermal comfort in indoor spaces by improving the performance of natural ventilation systems and achieving the optimal position of the openings. Also, field studies have been conducted in a high-rise office building equipped with DSF system in Tehran in order to increase the accuracy and precision of the simulation results. Then, the research cases are simulated in a three-dimensional space by numerical modeling of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and Navier-Stokes equations (RANS). 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Field studies The field study has been conducted in a smart high-rise office building in Tehran, with the aim of achieving a comprehensive understanding of the thermal comfort of current conditions and in order to develop design standards for office spaces. The characteristics of the building and the district are listed in Table 1 . In this table, general information of the district in which the building of the case study is situated, such as geographical location, type of climate, and height, as well as the characteristics of the building such as adjoining buildings, orientation, and the number of floors can be seen. The upper floors consist of six floors and each floor includes a corridor with two rooms in each hand; the division of office spaces in the rooms is done by wooden partitions. Also, on the southern facade of the building, a double-skin facade has been used; although the use of this system is only for aesthetic purposes and plays a minor role in the natural ventilation of the building. Besides, the presence of fixed windows has practically deprived the building of natural ventilation. On the other hand, the analysis of the bills of this building shows that the total energy consumption (electricity and gas) is 363.6 kWh per square meter, which is a high figure, and according to interviews with building managers; they have difficulty paying for energy. However, the building is in the range of acceptable thermal comfort in cold and hot seasons, the main reason being that the building is equipped with a building management system (BMS). Therefore, excessive energy consumption in high-rise office buildings requires the achievement of optimal patterns to solve this global problem. In the field studies section, the parameters were examined by (a) observation, (b) measurement by Datalogger Standard ST-174B and Fluke 975 Air Meter, and (c) questionnaire survey. Five calibrated dataloggers were used for continuous measurement of data; four devices were located inside the building and one device outside. Also, the Fluke 975 portable device was used to measure environmental parameters around each respondent when completing the questionnaire. The devices were located in these locations for four days and recorded the data permanently. The start time for measuring environmental data was September 4 and late summer. The recorded data have been used to simulate computational fluid dynamics and evaluate the thermal comfort model. In the next part, a questionnaire survey was conducted on different floors of the studied building. The questionnaire questions were designed based on indoor environmental quality and thermal satisfaction survey documents belonging to ASHRAE 55 and ISO 7730 as well as the characteristics of the building. The questionnaires consist of 6 sections: personal information, general information of the workplace, the thermal survey of the workplace, thermal satisfaction of the workplace, environmental quality, and users’ efficiency. Out of 150 selected cases, 36 women and 95 men (131 people in total) answered the questions. Statistical analysis of questionnaires and correlation of variables were performed using comprehensive and popular SPSS software. Fig. 1 shows images of the interior and exterior spaces of the building and the devices used in the study. Overall, this figure provides details of the case study of the research and tools used to measure environmental parameters. The upper section of this figure is dedicated to the details of the building of the case study, which includes exterior perspectives drawn in a three-dimensional space, interior plan separately for different floors, as well as real images of external form and internal layout. It is noteworthy that the underground floors of this building have been neglected in field studies and numerical modeling because these floors are mostly service spaces and are not used as spaces occupied by users. On the other hand, the external perspectives and the internal image of the work environment clearly illustrate the position of the openings. Furthermore, at the bottom of the figure are pictures of measuring devices that are related to the field measurement stage; the images of the Fluke 975 Air Meter and Datalogger Standard ST-174B devices are visible. 2.2 Numerical modeling 2.2.1 Case description In general, the proposed classifications in the study of natural ventilation systems are often based on geometric parameters and indoor ventilation strategies. Geometric parameters often include the height and width of the exterior facade, the dimensions of the rooms, the width of the cavity, the type and position of the sun control devices. Also, the ventilation strategies include; ventilation types (natural, mechanical, or hybrid), describing the airflow route in rooms equipped with cross ventilation (up-up, down-down, center-center, up-down, and down-up) [37], and describing the airflow route in DSFs (outside-room-cavity-outside, outside-room-cavity-room, outside-cavity-room-outside, etc.) [98]. Therefore, in the present study, according to the type of climate (hot and dry) and in order to increase natural ventilation in indoor spaces, the outside-room-cavity-outside route has been considered [88]. As can be seen in Fig. 2 (a); a hypothetical six-storey high-rise office building with cross ventilation and DSF is set as the research object. The configuration dimensions of the simulated building are selected based on the structure and dimensions of the case study building. The orientation of this building is north–south. In order to reduce the time of numerical simulation calculations and due to the same geometry and dimensions of the rooms, one row of rooms is considered on each floor (the case study building has two rooms on each floor that are connected by a middle corridor). Also, due to the fact that in buildings with transverse ventilation the optimal aspect ratio (H/W) is<1 [99]. All rooms are the same dimensions with length(x) × height(y) × width(z) = 8.0 m × 3.0 m × 6.0 m; these dimensions have also been confirmed in the research of Montazeri et al. which is about cross-ventilation [100]. The window dimension of each room is height(y) × width(z) = 1.0 m × 2.5 m. The size of the window width is according to the case study building settings (width(x) × height(y) = 2.5 m × 2.5 m), but the height has been chosen according to the position of the openings. The north facades of the rooms have openings for the wind to enter; on the south facade, which is connected to the DSF, there are outlet vents. The geometric dimensions of the DSF are based on the case study building and the configuration of the models in Safer [101], Hazem [72], and Mei [102] researches. Schematic view of computational domains used in CFD studies are presented in Fig. 2(b) and Table 2 . Fig. 2(a) shows the geometric details of the computational domain from both lateral and top views. In the same way, the dimensions of length, width, and height of the modeled building can be seen in three vectors of X, Z, and Y, respectively. According to studies by Franke et al., the computational domain to simulate environmental parameters in urban areas using computational fluid dynamics have certain principles and rules that are defined as a standard [103]. This document provides best practice guidelines for undertaking simulations that are used to evaluate micro-scale obstacle accommodating meteorological models. The boundary conditions represent the influence of the surroundings that have been cut off by the computational domain. The computational domain is constructed based on the practice guidelines for the CFD simulation of flows in the urban environment [24,103–105]; a distance of 5H from the building to the top and sides of the computational domain and a distance of 15H between the building and the outlet boundary downstream of the building. The upstream length of the domain is 5 times the height of the building. In Fig. 2(b), more detailed features of the dimensions of the building such as internal sizes of floors and the openings position as well as the characteristics of the double-skin facade system and its components are presented. This part of the figure displays the magnified schematics of the boundary conditions of the building, which includes external glazing walls, outlet vent of the cavity, and interior walls. Due to the location of the sun, the wall, which has glass material and an outlet vent, is the south side of the building. Additionally, the dimensions assigned to the different parts of the model are shown in Table 2. In Table 2, the sizes of the length, width, and height of the building (L, W, H1), the height of the floors (H2), the height of the outlet vent of the DFS (H3), the width of the glass facade (g), and the width of the cavity of DSF (e) are presented. The ventilation mechanism inside the building and the cavity of the DSF system are natural; in this way, the airstream enters from outside and is then expelled after passing through the interior space. The main airstream inlet and outlet are located on the north facade of the building for each floor and the top section of the south façade of the DSF, respectively. Depending on the different positions of the openings and vents, nine configurations are considered in this paper (Fig. 3 ). Fig. 3(a) depicts a scheme of the position of the inlet and outlet openings in the nine research models. In sector (b) of this figure, a profile of one of the model floors and details of the measurement plane and the points used in the final analysis are presented. • Configuration (A-1); inlet openings at the top section of the north facade, outlet openings at the top section of the south facade (up). • Configuration (A-2); inlet openings at the top section of the north facade, outlet openings at the middle section of the south facade (up center). • Configuration (A-3); inlet openings at the top section of the north facade, outlet openings at the bottom section of the south facade (up down). • Configuration (B-1); inlet openings at the middle section of the north facade, outlet openings at the top section of the south facade (center up). • Configuration (B-2); inlet openings at the middle section of the north facade, outlet openings at the middle section of the south facade (center). • Configuration (B-3); inlet openings at the middle section of the north facade, outlet openings at the bottom section of the south facade (center down). • Configuration (C-1); inlet openings at the bottom section of the north facade, outlet openings at the top section of the south facade (down up). • Configuration (C-2); inlet openings at the bottom section of the north facade, outlet openings at the middle section of the south facade (down center). • Configuration (C-3); inlet openings at the bottom section of the north facade, outlet openings at the bottom section of the south facade (down). Numerical simulation of CFD is done in three-dimensional space and in steady-state. The two main driving forces of natural airflow in indoor spaces are wind forces and thermal buoyancy. 2.2.2 Boundary conditions, solution methods, and computational meshes Ventilation performance can be assessed by experiments, analytical and/or semi-empirical formulae, simulations with zonal and multizone network models, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models [38]. CFD simulation examines turbulence modeling approaches, airflow patterns, the distribution of pollution, and the distribution temperature [106–108]. In the present study, the CFD code was used to simulate 3D, heat transfer, and fluid flow in the high-rise building. The finite volume method in the commercial CFD code ANSYS Fluent 17 is used to solve the approximate forms of the governing equations. The three-dimensional steady RANS equations are solved in combination with RNG turbulence model. This research is based on the finite-volume method and the SIMPLE algorithm was used for pressure–velocity coupling [109]. Numerical simulations have been performed in steady-state and pressure-based conditions. Also, Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) turbulence models and K-epsilon RNG turbulence equation have been used due to their high speed and accuracy [110]. The use of the K-epsilon RNG model in the evaluation of airflow patterns in indoor spaces has been fully proven in many studies both in the field of cross ventilation [10,17,24,36,48,50,111–113] and DSFs [73,77,114–118]. In pressure-based conditions, the mass conservation (continuity) and momentum equations are summarized as follows [119]; where u i is the velocity and x i is the spatial coordinate (Cartesian coordinate). (1) ∂ u i ∂ x i = 0 (2) u j ∂ u i ∂ x j = ρ - ρ 0 ρ g - 1 ρ ∂ p ∂ x i + ∂ ∂ x j v ∂ u i ∂ x j - u i " u j " Comparison and validation of turbulence models indicate that k-ε RNG, k-ω SST, and RSM models are most consistent with experimental data [48]. In studies related to natural ventilation systems, k-ε RNG and RSM models are more consistent than the k-ω SST model [117]. The turbulent kinetic energy (k) and dissipation (ɛ) transport equations in the RNG k-e turbulence model are given by Yakhot et al. [120,121]: (3) u i ∂ k ∂ x i = ∂ ∂ x i α k v eff ∂ k ∂ x i + 1 ρ P k + 1 ρ G b - ε (4) u i ∂ ε ∂ x i = ∂ ∂ x i α k v eff ∂ ε ∂ x i + 1 ρ C 1 ε ε k P k + C 3 ε G b - C 2 ε ε 2 k Where; u i = u , v , w v e l o c i t y t e n s o r s i n t h e x , y , z d i r e c t i o n s ( m / s ) u i " = u " , v " , w " v e l o c i t y f l u c t u a t i o n t e n s o r s i n t h e x , y , z d i r e c t i o n s ( m / s ) ρ = d e n s i t y , ε = e m i s s i v i t y , g = a c c e l e r a t i o n d u e t o g r a v i t y , α = a b s o r p t i o n c o e f f i c i e n t k = m o l e c u l a r d i f f u s i v i t y , v = m o l e c u l a r k i n e m a t i c v i s c o s i t y G b = t h e g e n e r a t i o n o f t u r b u l e n t k i n e t i c e n e r g y d u e t o b u o y a n c y , p = p r e s s u r e The empirical model constants C1∊ and C2∊ in transport equations for the RNG k-e model have values derived analytically by the RNG theory. The modeling constants for the RNG turbulence model adopted in this study are summarized as (by default in ANSYS FLUENT); C μ = 0.845 , C 1 ∊ = 1.42 , C 2 ∊ = 1.68 , C 3 ∊ = a n a l y t i c a l f o r m u l a , and wallprandtlnumber = 0.85 . In addition, two additional equations were implemented: the Boussinesq approximation, which allows the simulation of the natural convection, and the solar model for the solar gain [122]. The solar radiation was set up by using the solar model available in the CFD code. The production of buoyancy turbulence is always considered as the thermal effects of indoor spaces. Physical thermal properties - other than air density - are solved using the Boussinesq approximation; a common method for defining Reynolds stresses is to use the Boussinesq hypothesis [123]. In this paper, the combination of thermal effects, turbulence, and natural convection under steady-state has been performed using the Boussinesq model. This model is used in the analysis of flows where the fluid is affected by the buoyancy force and the temperature difference between the surfaces and the fluid is not large [124,125]. The inlet fluid (air) has a density of 1.225 (density = 1.225 kg / m3) and a thermal expansion coefficient of 0.003 (β = 0.003 1 / k). Table 3 shows the thermo-physical properties of the surfaces used in the simulations. Natural ventilation by wind current is significantly dependent on wind speed, most models, such as Gaussian models; consider a constant value for wind speed, but in fact, the wind speed changes with altitude changes [128]. The wind profile at the inlet of the computational grid is adjusted by the following power-law equation in the ASHRAE handbook [129,130]. In the inlet profile of the domain, the velocity inlet boundary condition with non-uniform velocity and uniform temperature of 27C is used. The reference wind speed (Uref) at the building height is 2.0 m/s and is defined on the velocity inlet boundary condition. Air velocity and temperature characteristics in the inlet boundary conditions have been selected based on field measurements in the location of the case study. The exponential relationship between wind speed changes is used to estimate the wind speed, based on this, the relationship between wind speed changes in relation to altitude and inlet velocity profile is described as follows; where H is the building height and Uref is the reference wind speed at the building height. (5) U ( y ) U ref = y H 0.22 The reference wind speed for the study area has been obtained using field measurements and the Fluke 975 device. The temperature difference of the vertical external walls is affected by the building height, wind speed, solar radiation intensity, and air temperature [131]. The temperature of the exterior surface of the DSF increases after receiving the solar radiation. Therefore, there is heat conduction between outer and inner surfaces and heat convection with the ambient environment. For the inner surface, it is assumed that the temperature difference between the surfaces is slight, and then the radiation heat transfer can be neglected [130]. The studies indicate that in hot climates the difference between the air temperature and the exterior surface of the sunward facades is approximately 13 K, and the temperature difference between the sunward and shady side walls is 10 k [130,132]. In research models, the outer surface of the DSF is the sunward side. As for the boundary condition, all surfaces of the building are set as heated walls. Boundary conditions of the symmetry are applied for lateral sides and the top plane, and the velocity inlet and pressure outlet are used for the inlet plane and outlet plane, respectively. It is noteworthy that the traits of the inlet flow and surfaces in this study are based on measured data by the devices mentioned in the previous sections for the city of Tehran and the location of the object. In September and during the noontime when the amount of solar radiation is in the maximum range; environmental measurements for the building show that the solar radiation intensity on the sunward side and shady side is 580 W/m2 and 98 W/m2, respectively. For both the sunward and shady side vertical walls at noon, the received solar radiation intensity changes in a slight range which can be considered as a steady-state condition. The values of the maximum solar radiation intensity on the sunward and shady side surfaces for different months of the year are given in Table 4 [133]. Therefore, the boundary condition in the outer walls is based on the solar radiation intensity and their surface temperature. On the interior surfaces, the applied boundary condition is based on the heat transfer coefficient and temperature. The heat transfer coefficient used in this study for walls and floor is 2.7 W/m2K and 2.9 W/m2K, respectively [134]. The average temperature data of the interior surfaces of the case study building in summer and when the BMS system was off are presented in a report entitled “Assessment of harmful factors in the workplace” by the Tehran Department of Industrial Medicine and Health [135]. Based on the data reported in the building shown in Fig. 4 ; the mean temperature of the interior surfaces is about 30 °C. This document is kept in the building library. Therefore the CFD model boundary conditions were provided by the field measurements of the environmental parameters in the case study building. The highest enveloped temperature of 40 °C has been applied on the sunward and the shady side has a temperature of 30.5 °C. The temperature of the interior surfaces is set at 30 °C. The characteristics of the inlet flow and boundary conditions of surfaces are given in Table 5 . The turbulence on the inlet boundary is characterized by turbulence intensity and length scale, which are 10% and 1 m. It is assumed that the cavity air is incompressible flow, with gravity as the only body force. A no-slip boundary condition was specified at all solid walls. The Under-Relaxation parameters and the discretization scheme used in the simulations are presented in Table 6 . The convergent values of residuals are as following: 1e-04 for continuity, 1e-05 for k, ɛ, x-, y- and z-velocity, and 1e-08 for energy [73,120]. An important feature of a proper fine mesh is that the value of y + for the grid close to the walls should be less than or close to 1 [107]. This principle has been observed in the present study. The mesh was generated using the software Gambit 2.4.6. The structured mesh elements are adopted to construct the whole computational domain, as shown in Fig. 5 (b). This figure illustrates a plot of the meshing in three magnified, bird's-eye, and lateral views. The dense and fine grids around the studied building are clearly visible in these images, which are effective in achieving accurate outputs. The domain near the interior surfaces, exterior walls, roof, and ground contains the smallest grids, cubic cells with dimensions of 0.01 × 0.01 × 0.01. To reduce the computational load, sparser grids are used in the regions away from the building. The largest cubic cells are with dimensions of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.3. More than 5,650,000 non-uniform cells have been produced in the configuration of research models. The mesh independence test was also performed by comparing three types of mesh (Fig. 5(a)). In this figure, the meshing of models with the same structure, a structured method, in three different cell ranges can be seen. This has been done with the aim of increasing the accuracy and precision of the simulation results. The number of cells of present gridings is in three categories; coarse, basic, and fine. The computational grid consists of hexahedral cells, with a high spatial resolution near the building, its openings, and the double-skin facade. The grid resolution results from a grid-sensitivity analysis using three different grids, created by refining and coarsening the basic grid with a factor of 1.5 in each direction. A grid-sensitivity analysis is conducted for RANS with the RNG k-epsilon model. The coarse, basic and fine grids contain 2,685,512 cells, 7,546,288 cells, and 20,299,514 cells, respectively. In the coarse, basic, and fine grids, 5, 6, and 7 cells are used across the single glazing thickness, respectively. Fig. 5(c) shows the results from the grid-sensitivity analysis in terms of the mean velocity and temperature in the third floor of the B-1 configuration along the middle vertical line in the vertical center plane. The fine and the basic grid provide almost identical results along these lines, while the results obtained with the coarse grid show clear deviations with the results of the basic grid. It can be seen that as the dimensions of the faces of the cells in the fine mesh increase, the temperature and mean velocity variables averagely witness a 1.05–1.2-fold deviation. While this difference in sizes of the cells of coarse and basic meshes is negligible; therefore, the simulation results are reliable in the final analysis and conclusion. The calculation time was approximately 90 s per iteration. The near-wall mesh has a y+ < 1 value; for the other surfaces, the value of y + is satisfied with 30 < y+ < 300. It is also important to know that the simulations were performed on a personal computer with a Core i7 GHz CPU and 8 GB of memory. ASHRAE Standard 55 uses the PMV model to set the requirements for indoor thermal conditions [136,137]. P.O. Fanger's studies have a significant impact on thermal comfort standards and the design and construction of office buildings [67,138–142]. It has also been proven that Fanger's model has an accurate performance in assessing the thermal comfort of naturally ventilated buildings [143,144]. The thermal comfort can be approximated by the following equations: (6) PMV = 0.303 e - 0.036 M + 0.028 L (7) PPD = 100 - 95 . e x p - 0.03353 . PMV 4 - 0.2179 . PMV 4 Therefore thermal comfort performance has been assessed by Fanger's equations and psychrometric chart [53,145]. The thermal comfort evaluation in this paper is done by a free online tool. The Center for the Built Environment (CBE) Thermal Comfort Tool is a tool for thermal comfort calculations and visualizations that complies with the ASHRAE 55–2020, ISO 7730:2005, and EN 16798–1:2019 Standards. The CBE Thermal Comfort Tool has several practical applications and each year is used by more than 49,000 users worldwide, including engineers, architects, researchers, educators, facility managers, and policymakers [146,147]. The CBE Thermal Comfort Tool is freely accessible via the following public URL: https://comfort.cbe.berkeley.edu . Based on field studies in 2015, the range of metabolic rate and clothing insulation in office spaces were measured 1.0–1.1 met and 0.69–1.34 clo, respectively [148]. Also, the DSF system is very effective in controlling the heat caused by temperature changes between outdoor and indoor spaces and the difference in surface temperatures [149]. 3 Model validation Model validation is essential for CFD studies before further analyzing. The accuracy of the current CFD model is demonstrated by comparing to the experimental and CFD simulation (RNG model) data obtained from the studies of Tominaga and Blocken in 2015 [150], and van Hooff et al. in 2017 [24]. The reduced-scale measurements of wind-induced cross-ventilation in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) wind tunnel at Niigata Institute of Technology in Japan were done by Tominaga and Blocken. The wind tunnel has a test section of 13 × 1.8 × 1.8 m3 (L × H × W). The ratio of computational domain in CFD modeling of the present paper is consistent with these two studies. The validation has been performed by comparing x-velocity (UX/UH) values in three areas: leeward (x/D = 0.125), center (x/D = 0.5) and windward (x/D = 0.875). The UH is the velocity at building height H. By comparing the data, a slight difference was observed between the results of numerical modeling and experimental. Comparisons of vertical air velocity profiles in three areas of the ground-floor room are shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 4(a) illustrates the vertical profiles of the dimensionless velocity along the windward-line of the indoor spaces. The vertical velocity witnesses a pattern along with fluctuation; thus it starts from an almost constant value at low heights and then observes a significant increase in the middle regions of room and finally attains a relatively constant value in areas near the ceiling, where the current CFD results agree well with the wind tunnel measurements. Fig. 6(b) depicts the vertical profiles of the dimensionless air velocity along the center-line. In the core of the room, the current CFD calculated velocity is slightly lower than the experimental values measured by Tominaga and Blocken, especially in the zones 0.5 < y/H < 0.7. In the near-floor and near- ceiling regions (y/H < 0.2 and y/H greater than 0.8), the current CFD calculated velocity is very close to the wind tunnel measurements that computed well the sharp near-floor and near-ceiling airflow. Fig. 4(c) compares the dimensionless streamwise velocity along the vertical leeward-line of the room. The current CFD results agreed well with the wind tunnel measurements inside the space. However, the free-stream streamwise velocity at the middle of the computational domain is higher than that of the wind tunnel measured value (0.3 < y/H < 0.5). At the floor and ceiling levels, the accordance between the results of numerical and experimental modeling is much high. The experimental and numerical data analysis provide about the same vertical location of maximum x-velocity in the jet region along each vertical line. In general, according to the patterns of airflow in this space and also the direction of rotation of vortices, the maximum vertical velocity is created in the middle heights of space. The results of the experimental study confirm this result and these outputs are also evident in the consequences of numerical modeling. On the other hand, the zones near the ceiling and floor have the lowest airflow speed, which is the same for all three positions: windward, leeward and middle area. By comparing the experimental results, numerical modeling, as well as the numerical simulation results of the present study, the overlap of vertical velocity values in numerical studies, is significant. It is remarkable that the RNG model in two numerical modelings (van Hooff et al. and the present researches) provides almost identical velocity profiles. These patterns and figures also follow the results of wind tunnels to an acceptable extent. Except for the lower areas of the windward region, the general flow pattern in the whole part of the enclosure is reproduced by the RNG model; while the flow in the upper part (y/H greater than 0.7) is more accurately reproduced by RNG. Thus, validations show an accurate trend, but there are also some differences that can be confirmed as reported in other studies. 4 Results and discussions 4.1 Results of the field study As mentioned in the previous sections, the analysis of the recorded environmental data and the thermal comfort model indicate that the case study is always in the acceptable range of thermal comfort in different seasons. However, the examination of electricity bills shows that electricity consumption per square meter is 157.2 kWh and for the whole building is 1,832,630 kWh, which is higher than the world standard. Various studies indicate that the use of natural ventilation and mixed-mode (i.e., buildings that operate with natural ventilation and air conditioning) in office buildings decreased cooling energy consumption [151–156]. Now the question arises whether natural ventilation without air conditioning system is able to provide thermal comfort in the high-rise buildings; this research answers this question. Fig. 7 (a) shows the air temperature and relative humidity of the outdoor space over five days; these data have been recorded by the Datalogger Standard ST-174B. The average air temperature during these five days is 27.35 °C. Therefore, based on the recorded outdoor data, the average inlet air temperature in numerical modeling has been considered to be 27 °C. As can be inferred from the graphs, the average relative humidity of the district in this period of 5 days experiences an upward trend with numerous fluctuations; while the average air temperature has almost constant maximum and minimum values despite many fluctuations. Field research for twelve office buildings in Iran shows that the appropriate operative temperature in summer to achieve acceptable thermal comfort conditions is below 26 °C [157]. In the case study of the present study, the relative humidity and standard air temperature range on summer days (23–26 °C) are significantly provided by the BMS system. It should be noted that the third day of data recording was a holiday and on this day the BMS system was off. Under these conditions, the interior of the building is not completely within the range of thermal comfort. Fig. 7(b) indicates the thermal comfort assessment on the first, second, third, and fifth floors of the building. In this way, by using the data extracted from the devices for measuring environmental parameters in the first, second, third, and fifth floors of the building and placing them in a psychometric diagram, the efficiency of indoor spaces in providing thermal comfort to users has been obtained. The red area in this diagram is the summer comfort zone and the blue dots in and around this area are the position of the interior spaces in the range of thermal comfort; placing these blue points within the red area means providing thermal comfort to the occupants in these places. In the next step, statistical analysis of questionnaires is performed; the statistical population in this study includes 27% females and 73% males. It is noteworthy that the ratio of female employees to male employees in this office building is<40%. The focus of the survey questions has mostly been on the thermal comfort conditions of the users. In order to investigate the effect of personal and environmental indicators on the thermal behavior of users in the workplace, important variables have been surveyed. In the next stage, the correlation between the variables and their consequence has been discussed. The variables of this research are divided into two categories of dependent and independent variables. Thus, by conducting a questionnaire survey of building users, the impact of independent variables on dependent variables is evaluated in the form of the existence of a correlation between them or its absence. The dependent variables in the survey of the present study are workplace temperature satisfaction, overall thermal sensation, thermal comfort, and interior quality. Thus, statistical analysis has shown the effect of independent variables such as gender, type of work, type of workplace, thermal sensation, floors position, and windows location on the dependent variables and the correlation between them. The results of statistical analysis (SPSS) of thermal comfort and occupants performance questionnaires and the frequency distribution show that; • 60.3% of the statistical populations believe that the value of air temperature is balanced. • 52.7% of the statistical populations are satisfied with the airflow and 45.8% believe that the airflow should increase. • 52.7% of the statistical populations are satisfied with the temperature difference between their head and ankle area. • 67.2% of statistical populations believe that they do not need to change the air temperature; this indicates that the majority of the statistical population is satisfied with the current thermal situation. The high percentage of thermal satisfaction of building users is quite reasonable and acceptable due to the existence of an intelligent system to control the parameters of the indoor environment. Afterwards, correlation tests and inferential statistics are examined; thus, the correlation coefficients of chi-squared (χ2) and Spearman (ρ) between the variables are calculated. If the significance level is<0.05, there is a statistically significant relationship between the variables. The results of SPSS statistical analysis are shown in Table 7 . In this table, the tick (✓) and cross (✗) marks in the results column indicate the existence of correlation and non-correlation between dependent and independent variables. Thus, different thermal sensations between various sexes in an identical space indicate the effect of a person's gender on his or her satisfaction with the environment temperature. In the surveys, women mostly felt warmer than men; as a result, a correlation was observed between the variables of satisfaction with workplace temperature and gender. This correlation trend was also proved for the variables overall thermal sensation, thermal sensation at the moment, and floors position. In contrast, there was no significant difference between the level of satisfaction of building users with different professions from the temperature of similar spaces. Interestingly, the impact of gender index on other dependent variables such as overall thermal sensation, thermal comfort, and indoor quality was also seen in the thermal survey of the users of the case study building. In addition, according to statistical analysis, the majority of building users believe that the window location affects the quality of the indoor environment. There is also a correlation between overall thermal sensation and thermal comfort of occupants and their type of work; whereas the type of work environment did not affect their overall thermal sensation and the level of thermal comfort as well as Interior quality. It is predicted that the lack of impact of this variable is due to the almost identical activities of employees in office spaces. Another interesting result of the questionnaire survey is the correlation between work satisfaction and thermal comfort, so it can be forecasted that people's mental condition is effective in their thermal sense. However, this area of study requires further research. The general conclusion from the data extracted from the statistical analysis shows that personal factors such as gender and type of work are very effective in users' thermal sensation, their satisfaction and thermal comfort, indoor quality. On the other hand, in this survey, two environmental variables, the position of floors and windows, were also discussed, and their impact on the dependent variables of the research was confirmed. Therefore, this study tries to provide more accurate results of the effect of these two variables by numerical modeling of this building and calculation of thermal comfort indicators. Thermal analysis of the environment by the statistical population shows that 61.1% prefer cooler air, and 45.8% believe that airflow should be increased. One of the most important statistical results of field studies in this paper is the significant correlation between window location and the quality of the indoor environment. A large percentage of users believed that controllable windows, in addition to improving thermal comfort, also increase indoor air quality. Also, laboratory research on the effect of window presence on thermal comfort was conducted using a randomized crossover laboratory experiment with 86 participants by Ko et al. [56]. The results of this study showed that in slightly warmer conditions, people residing near windows feel cooler and more comfortable. Therefore, the impact of windows in improving the thermal comfort of building users is confirmed. Given that, the windows of the case study building are fixed and without opening, and occupants believe that windows are effective in improving the quality of the environment; therefore, optimization of these elements can play an important role in providing thermal comfort; the effect of the presence and position of openings on thermal comfort in high-rise building using numerical simulation is investigated in this research. 4.2 Results of the numerical modeling The findings of the present study are consistent with the results of Tominaga and Blocken [38] and van Hooff et al. [24]. Note that these two studies have been performed for single-storey square buildings with simple geometry under isothermal conditions; Therefore, in the present study, the complex geometry of tall buildings, the double-skin facade, thermal behavior, and various parameters can affect the airflow patterns and other simulated components. Volumetric flow rate is used as one of the indicators to evaluate the ability of openings to induce fresh air [100,158]. The volumetric flow rate or ventilation rate (Q), can be calculated as the product of the vertical cross-sectional area (A) of the inlet opening and the average flow speed (U) passing through the opening [159,160]. (8) Q = A U m 3 / s Fig. 8 shows the volumetric flow rate or ventilation rate (Q) for research models. Therefore, before analyzing the simulation results and evaluating the thermal comfort, the ventilation rate is calculated using Eq (8). The purpose of this is to predict the volumetric flow rate of interior spaces without being affected by geometric and environmental parameters within the space and relying on the boundary conditions of the flow inlet (the vertical cross-sectional area of the inlet opening and the average flow speed passing through the opening). As can be seen from the prediction of the ventilation rate through the area of the openings and the average flow speed; the fifth and middle floors (2nd and 3rd) have the highest and lowest ventilation rates, respectively. Thus, the ventilation rate on the fifth floors is approximately 3.5 times that of the middle floors and 2 times that of the first and fourth floors. Therefore, in addition to the vertical cross-sectional area of the inlet opening and the average flow speed passing through the opening, it is essential to consider airflow velocity distribution its patterns within indoor spaces as a ventilation performance indicator; which will be discussed in the following sections. It is noteworthy that the non-uniform distribution of airflow around high-rise buildings is intensified by increasing the number of floors (more difference between the maximum and minimum air velocity of different heights). The average air velocity increases in the sections closer to the openings of upper floors and a clear difference in air velocity values between the cases are seen in the fourth and fifth floors. In general, the first (1st floor) and last floors (4th and 5th floors) are exposed to the highest ventilation rate, while the middle floors have the lower volumetric flow rates under the influence of the inlet flow patterns and their speed. On the other hand, the position of the openings is also effective in the ventilation rate; increasing the height of the openings, especially in the upper floors increases the velocity of the incoming airflow and the ventilation rate. 4.2.1 Velocity field The dynamics of vortices in indoor and outdoor environments are highly dependent on the configuration and geometry of space; vortices also significantly affect the distribution of heat and pollution [161,162]. Airflow patterns in different configurations are shown in Fig. 9 . The wind-driven airflow around a building forms a stagnation zone at the 2/3 height of the building on the windward side. The airflow above the stagnation zone moves toward the building top, while the airflow below the stagnation zone moves downward to the ground. In these conditions, the walls of the building as thermal plumes can drive the airflow under the influence of buoyancy force vertically to the upper parts, especially in high-rise buildings [130]. The wind flow after colliding with the body of the building goes in two directions; the ground, first and second floors are exposed to the downward airflow and the third, fourth, and fifth floors are exposed to the upward airflow. Therefore, airflow patterns are various on different floors of the building. In configurations A, the pattern and path of the jet are various from the inlet opening to the outlet opening on different floors. On the ground floor, according to the inlet flow pattern which is a combination of upward and downward flows, the jet has a straight path; therefore, a counter-clockwise vortex is formed in the areas below the jet. As the height of the outlet opening decreases, the intensity and size of the vortex also decrease. The pattern of indoor airflow is strongly influenced by the profile and speed of wind flow [130]. The downward inlet flow in the lower floors causes the jet to be directed downward immediately after passing through the inlet opening; this airflow pattern then forms two low-velocity zones. In this case, a clockwise vortex is created in the upper zone of the jet (near the ceiling) and a counter-clockwise vortex is created in the lower zone of the jet (leeward area). The position of the outlet opening in the bottom section of the facade increases the size of the clockwise vortex and decreases the size of the counter-clockwise vortex. The pattern of airflow on the second floors is similar to that of the first floors, except that the direct inlet flow increases the intensity and size of the jet. Therefore, the size of the clockwise vortices decreases and the counter-clockwise vortex covers a larger zone of the leeward area. As the height of the building increases, on the third, fourth, and fifth floors, the jet of the incoming flow has a direct path to the outlet after passing through the inlet opening. Thus, the size of the clockwise vortex near the ceiling decreases and the counterclockwise vortex becomes larger. On the third floor, the jet path is determined by the outlet opening position; the clock vortex is eliminated when the outlet opening is at the top of the facade. As the height and wind speed increase in the fourth and fifth floors, the jet passes through the area near the roof ceiling then leans toward the outlet opening. Under these conditions, a large counter-clockwise vortex is formed in the lower region of the jet. The incoming jet on the ground, fourth and fifth floors are mainly directed towards the ceiling due to the Coandă effect [38,163]; It shows a clear flapping behavior depending on the position of the outlet opening, both upward and horizontal or even downward. The position of the inlet opening in the middle section of the facade increases the size of the clockwise vortex above the jet. In configurations B, the incoming jet flow is on average directed downwards, and the flipping behavior of the jet is very noticeable as its direction varies between horizontal and inclined downwards. Since these vertical structures originate from the jet, they subsequently pass over the lower levels; as a result, the interaction between the jet and the rest of the indoor flow is strong. However, in the upper levels of the first and second floors, they lead to increased heat accumulation by creating clockwise vortices and low-pressure zones. As the height increases in the upper floors, the jet is directed upwards upon entering and behaves similarly to configurations A. In configurations C, the intensity of heat accumulation and the creation of low-pressure zones in the upper levels of the room increase depending on the position of the inlet opening. Also, the more the outlet opening is located in the lower sections of the facade, the larger the area of these zones (see Fig. 9, configurations C-2 and C-3). On the ground, first, second and third floors of configuration C, the direction of the jet is clearly downwards and, depending on the position of the outlet opening, the outlet is directed upwards, and downwards or straight. This behavior is attributed both to the Coandă effect and to the structure of the standing vortex upstream of the inlet opening which provides a downward direction to the incoming jet [163,164]. Therefore, despite these two factors, the interaction between the jet and the indoor airflows of the building is less compared to configurations A. In the upper floors of configurations C, similar to the other two configurations, the jet is inclined upwards due to the direction of the incoming flow. In the upper floors of configuration C with increasing indoor flow resistance; the flow velocity and size of the counter-clockwise vortex below the jet are reduced compared to the other two configurations. The presence of a double-skin façade is also an important factor in the airflow patterns of floors due to the position of the outlet openings. In the present study, the double-skin façade acts as an “air exhaust”; in this way, the air leaving the rooms is directed to the outside through the cavity and convection, thus the DSF ventilation system allows hot air to be evacuated. The buoyancy force in the cavity prevents hot air from re-entering the rooms by increasing the airflow velocity. Fig. 10 shows the average air velocity in the three areas of leeward, center, and windward on the first to fifth floors. The analysis of the average air velocity in different configurations indicates that due to the airflow patterns and the increase in air velocity at upper levels, the indoor air velocity also increases. As mentioned in the previous section, increasing the height of floors and openings increases the velocity of airflow and ventilation rate. In the upper floors, the thermal plume and the buoyancy lift lead to the formation of an upward flow pattern and increase the velocity in these areas. On the other hand, the non-uniform distribution of airflow in the central parts of the building reduces the air velocity in the middle floors. In the lower floors, the airflow is downward due to wind force and has a higher air velocity compared to the middle floors. The effect of the position of the inlet and outlet openings on the indoor air velocity is also quite evident. In the leeward area, the highest indoor air velocity occurs on the first to fourth floors and under the influence of the position of inlet opening at the top and middle sections of the façade (configurations A and B). In general, with increasing height in the floors, the effect of the inlet opening position in the bottom sections of the facade on strengthening the air velocity of the leeward area increases. Therefore, in the leeward area, configurations B and C have better performance in strengthening the air velocity on the fifth floors; while the performance of configurations A is more impressive on the lower floors. The highest indoor air velocities belong to “the combination of up openings in the lower floors” and “the combination of down openings in the upper floors”. The C-3 case has the highest indoor air velocity compared to other cases due to the position of the openings and the direction and power of the incoming jet. The effect of the position of the openings on the air velocity of the center area of the room is less than the other two areas. However, as the height increases, the effect of the opening position increases. Finally, Fig. 10(b) clearly shows that configurations A increase the indoor air velocity on the third, fourth and fifth floors. The position of the outlet opening in the bottom section of the facade increases the indoor air velocity by reducing the size of the counter-clockwise vortex on the upper floors. The effect of the position of the inlet and outlet openings in the windward area is different on the floors. On the first, second, and third floors, the highest air velocities are observed in the A-1, B-1, and C-1 configurations and are affected by the outlet opening position (top section of the facade); Therefore, the presence of the ceiling in this area prevents the spread of a strong jet. Low indoor flow resistance in these configurations also leads to increased air velocity; on the other hand, the opening position near the stagnation zone causes a high-pressure difference between the openings. The high-pressure difference between the two openings (inlet and outlet openings) always increases the flow rate. Airflow behavior in the upper floors is different from that of the lower floors; thus, on the fifth floors, the position of the outlet opening at the bottom section of the facade leads to an increase in the flow velocity (configurations A-3, B-3, and C-3). Because directing the jet to the upper of the room and removing it from the lower levels help to reduce the low-pressure zones in this area. The mean velocity of airflow in different areas of indoor spaces shows a direct relationship between the volumetric flow rate calculated through the openings and the indoor ventilation rate. As can be seen, the fifth floors have more suitable natural ventilation; it is also more intense in the center and windward areas. An overall conclusion from air velocity diagrams shows that configurations A have the highest volumetric flow rate. However, according to the airflow patterns in configurations A, they have the lowest air exchange efficiency due to short-circuiting of air and insufficient mixing of air inside the building. Direct jet paths increase volumetric flow rate; but on the other hand, they reduce the efficiency of air exchange in indoor spaces by reducing the turbulence of the air layers. The lowest average velocity has been obtained for configurations C, which can be attributed to the position of the inlet opening. Therefore it is necessary to analyze the velocity values along a horizontal line. The mean velocity of indoor airflow on the horizontal line with a height of 1.5 m above the floor of the rooms is shown in Fig. 11 . When the outlet opening position is a fixed parameter, increasing the inlet opening height increases the mean airflow velocity in the first and second floors. By increasing the height of the building on the third and fourth floors, the inlet opening in the center of the facade increases the velocity. Also, increasing the height of the building reduces the effect of the inlet opening position on the internal airflow velocity and the difference in the amount of mean velocity in the upper floors is small. On the other hand, on the fifth floors, there is an indirect relationship between the height of the inlet opening and the velocity of the airflow. However, considering the induced air flow rate into the fifth-floor rooms by increasing the height, it can be seen that these floors have higher speeds and better conditions in areas close to the ceiling. High velocity in these areas affects the mean velocity of room airflow. Therefore, the inlet openings position at the bottom section of the facade helps to increase the velocity of airflow in the lower areas. The highest and lowest percentages of increase in indoor air velocity under the influence of the inlet opening position belong to C3-A3 (350%) and C1-B1 (7%) cases, respectively. When the inlet opening position is a fixed parameter, the effect of the outlet opening position on the air velocity depends on the height of the floors and the inlet opening position. Thus, with increasing the height of the outlet opening, the air velocity increases in the lower floors and decreases in the upper floors. However, the position of the inlet opening is also very effective; reducing the height of the inlet opening increases the effect of the outlet openings at the top sections of the facade on the upper floors. The effect of the outlet opening height on increasing the air velocity in configurations A, B, and C is observed on the “first”, “first and second”, and “first to third” floors, respectively. However, the comparison of mean velocity diagrams on the horizontal line in research cases shows that the effect of the outlet opening position is less than the inlet opening position. The highest and lowest percentages of increase in indoor air velocity under the influence of the outlet opening position belong to B1-B3 (72%) and B1-B2 (<1%) cases, respectively. The most optimal combined position of inlet and outlet openings with the aim of increasing the indoor airflow velocity in the first to fifth floors (at a height of 1.5 m) are configurations (A1), (A1-A2), (B1-B2-B3-A2-A3, B3), and (C3), respectively. 4.2.2 Temperature field Thermal evaluation in indoor environments, especially office spaces, has always been considered by researchers and engineers; because ensuring the level of thermal comfort directly affects the employees' productivity [28,157,165,166]. The difference in air density due to the difference in temperature leads to air thrust, buoyancy effect, and thermal turbulences [167]. The thermal buoyancy force in a double-skin façade increases the flow velocity, but in areas where the flow is circulating. Hot air masses are formed at the bottom of the cavity due to the presence of low-velocity vortices and reduced airflow (see Fig. 12 ). The value and intensity of hot air masses depend on the position of the openings; there is a direct relationship between the height of the outlet opening and the value and intensity of heat at the bottom of the cavity. The heat inside the cavity is transferred to the interior spaces through transparent facades (radiation) and openings (convection) and increases the air temperature of the rooms. Temperature isotherms inside the floors are influenced by the motion pattern of the jets. Therefore, reducing the temperature in indoor spaces requires air exchange and mixing of air layers, and high-velocity jets with a direct path have a slight effect on the decline of air temperature. The motion pattern of the jets in the first, second and third floors of configurations A, improves natural ventilation and decreases the internal air temperature by increasing the air exchange rate. On the fourth and fifth floors, the direct path of the jet leads to a decrease in air circulation and an increase in temperature inside these floors compared to the lower floors. Also, the vortices increase the air temperature in these areas by trapping hot air masses. A similar process is observed in configurations B; however, the position of the inlet opening and the diversion of the jet create more suitable conditions compared to configurations A. The bulk of heat accumulation in configurations B belongs to low-pressure zones near the ceiling due to the opening position and insufficient ventilation in these areas. Temperature contours for configurations C show different patterns. The position of the inlet opening in the bottom section of the facade increases the air temperature in the areas near the ceiling of the first to fourth floors by creating direct jets. The air temperature in these areas increases by 3.0 °C to 3.5 °C due to low air circulation. The different pattern of the incoming jet on the fifth floors reduces the air temperature in the areas near the ceiling; the process of increasing the air temperature is observed in the areas near the floor. In order to study the temperature data in different floors more precisely, Fig. 13 indicates the average temperature graphs in the three areas of leeward, center, and windward. As can be seen in the figure, the largest difference in the average internal air temperature is due to the position of the inlet opening and belongs to the area leeward (the area nearby the inlet opening). In configurations A and B, with increasing height, the average temperature in the upper floors increases. However, configurations B have more effective behavior in reducing indoor air temperature due to appropriate ventilation and airflow patterns. The thermal behavior of the interior of configurations C is quite different. Height and the average air temperature in these configurations have an indirect relationship; thus, the average air temperature in the upper floors decreases with increasing height. In this case, the second and third floors have the highest average internal air temperature in the three areas of leeward, center, and windward. The effect of the outlet opening position in reducing the air temperature is less compared to the inlet opening position. However, data analysis shows that the effect of the position of the inlet and outlet openings in the upper floors is much greater than the lower floors. In configurations A and B, the ambient temperature increases as the outlet openings are installed in the higher sections as the mixing of air layers decreases. In configurations C, the outlet opening position at the top of the façade reduces the air temperature by increasing the mixing of air and ventilation. Analysis of temperature data indicates that opposite openings and direct-direction jets increase the ambient temperature while increasing the airflow velocity by reducing the turbulence of the air layers. Therefore, combining the position of the openings that are not facing each other helps to reduce the air temperature of the interior spaces by increasing the air circulation. On the other hand, the buoyancy force inside the cavity creates enough power to suck the hot air out of the rooms and strengthen the vertical natural airflow. The simultaneous effect of the outlet opening position and the DSF on the air temperature of the windward area is also evident; the position of the outlet opening in the bottom section of the facade also reduces the heat transfer of the cavity to the first floors by preventing the accumulation of heat at the bottom of the cavity. The average air temperature in the DSF cavity for the research configurations is shown in Fig. 14 . The comparison of the data shows that the effective factor in the air temperature of the DSF interior is the position of the outlet opening. Therefore, the outlet openings in the upper sections of the facade trap more heat in this area by creating a large low-pressure zone at the bottom of the cavity; the result is an upward trend in the average DSF temperature. The hot air masses at the bottom of the cavity are transferred to higher layers due to the convection effect and increase the average air temperature of the building. Therefore, configurations A-3, B-3, and C-3 reduce the air temperature of the cavity by ventilating its layers. The position of the inlet opening is also effective in reducing the cavity temperature; the opposite openings in configurations A-1, B-2, and C-3 increase the airflow velocity entering the cavity by creating high-speed and direct-direction jets. Hence, heat dissipation is accelerated and the average cavity temperature in these configurations decreases. The PMV / PPD model has been generalized as a known model for assessing the thermal comfort of the occupied zone in non-air-conditioned buildings in warm climates [136,168,169]. Natural ventilation performance is affected by a combination of different parameters such as ventilation type and opening position; which significantly affects the thermal comfort of indoor spaces. In the present study, according to most researches, the PMV model developed in the CFD mathematical model has been used to evaluate thermal comfort, which is valid for buildings without air-conditioning and warm climates [112]. The utilization of wind flow and natural ventilation increases the level of thermal comfort in high-rise buildings by reducing the indoor air temperature. Fig. 15 shows the PMV values for the study configurations in the center area of the floors. The green area marked in this figure is the range of thermal comfort. As can be seen, configurations A and B perform better in providing indoor thermal comfort conditions. Configurations C provide acceptable PMV values to a slight extent due to the inlet opening position; because the position of the inlet opening in the bottom section of the facade reduces the ventilation rate and increases the indoor air temperature. This thermal sensation is also observed for the lower floors in the higher areas of the room (H ≥ 2.5). The main reason for the increase in PMV values in some parts of different floors is the dynamics of vortices and the lack of proper natural ventilation. The largest effect of the outlet opening position in configurations A belongs to the third floor; by reducing the height of the outlet opening and changing the airflow pattern, the thermal comfort in the lower areas (H ≤ 2.0) improves, and the PMV value increases in the areas near the ceiling (H ≤ 2.0). However, the position of the outlet opening in the top sections has the opposite effect and the PMV value decreases with increasing height. The thermal comfort conditions in configurations B are very similar to configurations A, and this similarity is greater in the upper floors. The significant difference between the two configurations is evident in the areas near the ceiling (H ≥ 2.5) of the lower floors. The inlet opening position in configuration B creates a slightly warm thermal sensation by reducing the airflow velocity and creating low-pressure zones near the floor of the lower floors. Also, as the height of the outlet opening decreases, the indoor space moves further away from the thermal comfort zone and the PMV value increases. The study of thermal comfort conditions in the central area of the rooms for configurations C shows that the position of the inlet opening in the bottom section of the façade is only able to provide thermal comfort on the fifth floors. The combination of the position of the inlet and outlet openings in the bottom section of the facade also makes the situation more unfavorable. Because by creating low-pressure zones and trapped masses of hot air in the upper part of the jet, internal ventilation decreases and PMV values increase. This condition is more severe in areas near the ceiling and for all floors, in which case the average values of PMV: 0.85 and PPD: 20%. At other heights in the interior, the PMV values are located on the boundary line. The average values of PMV and PPD in the three areas of leeward, center, and windward of the research models are shown in Fig. 16 . Comparison of thermal comfort index (TCI) data in research configurations shows that the inlet opening position plays a decisive role in providing thermal comfort and the effect of the outlet opening position is much less. Also, among the three inlet opening positions, the position of the inlet opening in the top section of the facade (configurations A) is the most optimal position in terms of providing thermal comfort in high-rise buildings by increasing the flow velocity and decreasing the indoor air temperature. On the other hand, the center area of the floors is more suitable than the leeward area due to lack of air circulation and heat accumulation, and the windward area due to the penetration of direct sunlight from the sunward side. The windward area is only on the fifth floors in the range of thermal comfort due to the proximity to the sunward side and the high radiant temperature. The 5th floors have a lower average temperature than the other floors due to their proximity to the main outlet vent on the DSF, which creates a high-velocity and high-pressure area. Also, with increasing altitude, the value of turbulent kinetic energy in the double-skin facade increases, and the result is a decrease in heat intensity in this area. Given that thermal comfort studies in SSF and DSF buildings show that the effect of DSF on improving indoor thermal comfort is negligible, however, the role of the double-skin facades is somewhat effective in reducing the direct penetration of sunlight and controlling heat in indoor spaces. The presence of the DSF system in the southern side improves the thermal comfort of indoor spaces to some extent by reducing the air temperature in the space adjacent to the façade [70]. On the other hand, the stack effect of the double-skin façade system creates a vertical ventilation flow. However, protecting the interior of high-rise buildings from the heat in the tropical climate and providing complete thermal comfort in these areas is not possible only with the use of natural ventilation and passive systems such as DSFs. Therefore, equipping high-rise buildings with cooling systems in hot climates is always necessary. The use of passive systems and natural ventilation with controlled tools, in addition to improving thermal comfort conditions, help to reduce energy consumption and climate change. 5 Conclusion In this research, field study and numerical modeling have been conducted with the aim of investigating the effect of natural ventilation and the DSF system on improving the thermal comfort of high-rise buildings in hot and dry climates. The results of the field study show that high-rise office buildings equipped with the building management system (BMS) are very effective in achieving thermal comfort. Also, energy consumption in these buildings is much higher than the standards. The use of controllable openings and natural ventilation in high-rise buildings significantly reduces cooling energy consumption. Therefore, numerical modeling with the aim of the effect of natural ventilation on thermal comfort has been done in the second step of this research. CFD simulation has investigated the height and position of the openings and the use of the cross-ventilation effect of the building and the stack effect of the DSF. A summary of the results of the present study is as follows: • High-rise buildings equipped with a building management system (BMS) are highly efficient in providing thermal comfort to occupants. • Analysis of survey questionnaire data displays that in addition to personal factors like gender, there is a correlation between environmental variables such as the position of floors and windows and the thermal sensation and thermal comfort. Therefore, the suitable design of these parameters is very effective in providing comfort to users. • The formation of thermal plumes on the exterior walls and the buoyancy effect create various patterns of inlet jets on different floors. • As the height of the building increases, the volumetric flow rate and thermal comfort index in the last floors of high-rise buildings significantly improve compared to the lower floors. • The position of the building openings and the combination of their different positions can have a positive effect on the performance of the cross-ventilation system of tall buildings. Among nine different configurations; up, up center, up down, center up, center, center down, down up, down center and down, configurations up (A) have a more suitable effect on internal flow rate. However, the opposite openings and the formation of direct-direction jets, while increasing the velocity of the airflow, increase the ambient temperature by reducing the turbulence in the air layers. Configurations down (B) have the highest average internal temperature due to the creation of low-pressure zones above the jet and low volumetric flow. However, the optimal position of the openings in different floors of a high-rise building is various. Thus, in the lower floors, configurations A and B have the best trend of decreasing the internal temperature, and in the upper floors, this trend is observed in configurations C. The DSF system also helps to improve the thermal control of indoor spaces by creating the stack effect, air circulation, and vertical ventilation. The examination of thermal comfort indices in high-rise buildings in hot and dry areas indicates that natural ventilation alone is not able to provide thermal comfort conditions, and under these conditions, indoor areas are in the range of “slightly warm” sensation. However, the inlet opening position has a more effective role in providing thermal comfort conditions and the effect of the outlet opening position is much less. The inlet opening position at the top section of the facade creates more suitable conditions in terms of average PMV values by increasing the airflow velocity. Moreover, data analysis depicts that as the height of the building increases, the thermal comfort conditions on the last floor of the building improve; however, there is no completely positive correlation between these two variables, and the middle floors are mostly outside the comfort zone. Increasing the productivity and satisfaction of employees in office buildings needs providing complete thermal comfort in indoor environments; the results of field studies and numerical modeling of an office building in hot and dry climates show that providing a comfort zone requires the use of cooling systems. It should be noted that the use of passive systems such as DSF and equipping the building with natural ventilation and controlled tools, although they have a slight effect on improving thermal comfort, help reduce energy consumption and climate change. Therefore, the use of natural ventilation is recommended as a complementary strategy in high-rise buildings. The study of thermal comfort in high-rise buildings and provide appropriate design patterns is a very important issue that in addition to optimizing energy consumption, also affects employees' satisfaction and productivity. The examination of various parameters in this field can be an important step in the advancement of sustainable architecture, the evaluation of these parameters is recommended in future research. Simultaneous study of natural ventilation and HVAC systems, as well as achieving effective solutions to increase the efficiency of the DSF system with the aim of improving the thermal comfort of indoor spaces in warm climates, are suggested for future research in this field.
