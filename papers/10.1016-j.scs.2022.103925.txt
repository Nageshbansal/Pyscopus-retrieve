Severe high-temperature leads significant risks of human health under the highly population concentration and climate change. The thermal sensitivity to high temperature is needed to be quantified associated with different population characteristics. Thermal condition was quantified by universal thermal climate index (UTCI) and thermal sensitivity was identified by thermal sensation votes (TSV), thermal comfort votes, and thermal unacceptability votes based on 667 questionnaires in Beijing, China. This study designated four indicators, i.e., neutral temperature, neutral temperature range, tolerance temperature, and tolerance temperature range to analyze the effects of individual characteristics on thermal sensitivity. A one-way ANOVA was used to identify the effects of long-term adaptation and psychological factors. Results showed that: (1) Older residents had a higher neutral temperature, narrow tolerance temperature range, and lower tolerance temperature of 1.2 °C UTCI than younger residents. (2) People with chronic disease had a narrow tolerance temperature range and lower tolerance temperature of 1.3 °C UTCI than healthy ones; (3) The proportion of people who voted strong thermal sensation (TSV≥2) rated the highest in building areas, while the proportion decreased 31.6% in spaces with dense trees; (4) Residential history and city attractiveness had significant impacts on mean thermal sensation votes and mean thermal comfort votes, excluding the effect of thermal stress level. This study provided useful implications of specific adaption for summer extreme heat according to different population characteristics. Keywords Sensitive population Age Gender Thermal preference Thermal history 1 Introduction Growing evidence has prompted the perspective that summer extreme high temperatures are increasing in cities worldwide (Jones et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020a). It is projected to be more frequent, even under a moderate climate change scenario (Mukherjee et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2014). Unbridled urbanization reshapes the underlying surface and alters the energy budget at the ground surface, which was partially responsible for the increased rates of thermal environment deterioration. Among them, the urban heat island (UHI) effect is a well-known phenomenon in contemporary cities, which will exacerbate unfavorable summer microclimate and consequently affect the environment experience of humans. High temperature due to the combined effects of global warming and urbanization could cause heatstroke, respiratory system, and cardiovascular system diseases (Sharmin et al., 2019; Vaidyanathan et al., 2019; Wang & Yi, 2021), increasing the vulnerability of urban residents (Hong et al., 2019; Jenerette et al., 2016). This issue made the identification of vulnerable populations non negligible (Mora et al., 2017). Urban outdoor spaces are indispensable for human daily life. People perform exercise, recreation, and social interaction in various types of outdoor spaces, such as parks, squares, and pedestrian streets (Canan et al., 2019). The temperature increase that primarily due to the climate change and land use change in urban areas has worsen outdoor thermal environment. Thermal environment of outdoor spaces have significant effects on their users’ thermal comfort and experiences in high-density cities. This has led to the increasing public discussion on the evaluation of outdoor human thermal sensation, especially during the hot summer. Many thermal indexes have been established to facilitate assessment of thermal environment. The Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) is developed for the universal application in various climate zones (Blazejczyk et al., 2012), which reports a relatively better predictions (Lai et al., 2014). Assessing thermal environment in outdoor spaces is more difficult due to the intense variation of meteorological variables, physiological differences, and sociocultural adaptation (Johansson et al., 2014). A common way of assessing the thermal environment is to ask subjects to provide a thermal sensation votes. As mentioned in previous studies, neutral temperature and acceptable threshold are considered to be effective indicators for evaluating the thermal comfort and tolerance. Previous studies have attempted to explore adaptation strategies to counteract the over-heat in urban areas, such as tree cooling (Rahman et al., 2020), urban geometry (Shimazaki et al., 2022), cool surfaces (Yuan et al., 2022), solar awnings (Rossi et al., 2022), and mist spraying (Ulpiani et al., 2019). Landscape pattern plays an important role in urban cooling and providing thermal comfort spaces. Increasing shading is a direct measure to improve pedestrian comfort. Nasrollahi et al. (2021) found that urban shading can reduce the PET up to 17.6 °C. In addition to providing shade (Chen et al., 2021), trees also has cooling effects through transpiration. Therefore, increasing urban green spaces is a commonly applied mitigation strategy against urban heat. Increasing the ratio of crown diameter to branch height helps to reduce thermal sensation and provide thermal comfort environment (Zhang & Gou, 2021). The cooling effect of water bodies has been proven by numerous evidences (Wang & Ouyang, 2021). Setting simple elements like fountains or constructed wetlands can promote thermally comfortable microclimates (Ulpiani et al., 2019). The hybrid of semi-outdoor spaces, mid-rise and high-rise building forms in Singapore can improve pedestrian comfort (Gamero-Salinas et al., 2021). Retro-reflective materials building facade and road (Shimazaki et al., 2022) are effective in reducing the values of various thermal indexes (Yuan et al., 2022). Lai et al. (2019) demonstrated that urban geometry has the highest reduction of PET 18.0 K in residential regions during summer among vegetation, urban geometry, water bodies, and cool surfaces measures. Given that excessive hot weather is likely to occur far more regularly, understanding human thermal sensitivity factors and quantifying people's tolerance threshold are of significant concern. When exposed to the same thermal environment, heat sensitivity likely differ among residents with different characteristics. Insights on human heat sensitivity factors advance the understanding of city vulnerability and provide valuable thermal requirement information for urban planners. Globally, the share of population aged 65 years or over increased from 6% in 1990 to 9% in 2019 (United Nations, 2019). In parallel, people with chronic disease are on the rise over the world. The elderly and chronic patients with less immune and decreased ability of body temperature regulation is susceptible to health threats in the extremely hot summer, even the risk of death (Wang et al., 2020b). Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the effect of age and physical condition on thermal sensitivity. Actually, thermal sensation and preference of the elderly is different from that of the young when exposed to the same thermal conditions (Hoof et al., 2017). Previous indoor studies confirmed that older adults are less sensitive to temperature changes (Hoof et al., 2017; Jiao et al., 2017). Females are found to be more dissatisfied than males in existing studies (Indraganti et al., 2021), especially in over-cold and over-heat buildings (Choi et al., 2010; Karjalainen, 2012; Wang et al., 2018). Female prefer a higher operative temperature in buildings than male (Indraganti et al., 2015; Jowkar et al., 2020). However, these studies was conducted in indoor thermal environment. In addition, direct or indirect factors of long-term thermal adaptation and psychological factors also affect thermal sensitivity. Long-term thermal histories reflect the adaptation process of people to the thermal environment. The influence of climate zone history on the related thermal responses have been discussed (Lam et al., 2021). People visiting open spaces for thermal reason is likely to have lower thermal comfort than social reason due to the high expectations of thermal environment. Urban persons felt thermally more comfortable than open-air persons (Knez et al., 2009). Individuals who are satisfied with acoustics and aesthetics conditions perceive higher levels of thermal comfort than those who are dissatisfied (Lau & Choi, 2021). On the whole, previous studies was mainly focused on indoor thermal comfort and the regional difference of outdoor thermal comfort, while they was lack of heat sensitivity comparison among different population groups, especially in outdoor spaces. Comprehensive aspects of heat sensitivity need to be elucidated systematically to help vulnerability warning and provide specific designing strategies for diverse outdoor spaces. The objectives of this study are: • Investigate the thermal sensation in different outdoor landscape spaces; • Quantify the thermal sensitivity difference in relation to gender, age, and physical condition based on neutral temperature and tolerance thresholds; • Reveal the effect of thermal adaptation and psychological factors on thermal sensitivity. 2 Material and methods 2.1 Study area Beijing (39°26′−41°03′ N, 115°25′−117°30′ E), the capital of the People's Republic of China, is located in northern China. The west, north, and northeast of Beijing are surrounded by mountains, while the southeast is plain areas (Fig. 1). It has a typical temperate monsoon climate, characterized by distinct seasons with hot and humid summer and cold winter. The extreme temperature in summer may exceed 35 °C and the average monthly maximum temperature occurs in July. The seasonal distribution of precipitation varies greatly, with 80% of the annual precipitation concentrated in summer. Fig. 2 shows the monthly average, maximum, and minimum temperature and average relative humidity of Beijing from 2016 to 2020. As a high-density city with 21.9 million population (National Bureau of Statistics, 2020), Beijing has undergone increasing urban heat island in recent years (Meng et al., 2018), posing a challenge to the human settlement environment. 2.2 Field measurements Our investigation was focused on summer because the heat stress becomes a health issue with hot weathers. The measurements were conducted at parks, squares, streets and commercial areas to cover wide participants during 13 days in July, August, and September 2021. The specific sites were selected based on landscape elements in order to cover diverse landscape characteristics, including spaces with tree, tree-lined street, waterside, building area, sunlit and pavilion (Fig. 1). The on-site measurements record air temperature (Ta ), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (Va ) and globe temperature (T g ) from about 9:00 am to 6:00 pm at 1 minute intervals. All measurements were performed during sunny conditions and partly cloudy skies, excluding rainy weathers. Automatic meteorological stations are installed at a height of 1.5 m from ground. Since the tripod does not allow the measurement of wind speed at a height of 10 m, the wind speed is measured at a height of 1.5 m. The instruments used for meteorological variables are Delta HD 32.3 and specific parameters are listed in Table 1 . All the instruments complied with the standard of ISO 7726 (ISO, 1998). The questionnaires were collected simultaneously with the microclimate measurements. The investigation was conducted from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm considering sunshine and the main time periods for human outdoor activities. As the health status involves privacy and ethical concerns, informed consent was obtained before the questionnaires were collected from the respondents. The collected data in the questionnaire survey was anonymized. The field survey was conducted by four people (State key Laboratory of Urban and Regional Ecology) who had been trained in the use of instruments and understanding of the questionnaire. In order to ensure wide crowd and avoid selection bias, interviewees were selected randomly in measurements sites. The questionnaire consists of two parts and the average completion time was about 5–8 min. The first part recorded respondents' basic attributes, including height, weight, gender, age, clothing, activity, physical condition, residential history, education level, economic level, city attractiveness, and whether living alone. In the second part, respondents were asked to indicate their thermal sensation, thermal comfort, thermal acceptability, and thermal preference. Thermal sensation votes were designed based on ASHRAE 7-point scale. Thermal comfort votes (TCV) and preference votes were rated on the three-point McIntyre (McIntyre, 1980). Thermal acceptable votes include 'acceptable' and 'unacceptable'. The specific scales information was shown in Table 2 . Clothing insulation value and metabolic rate were calculated according to respondents' clothing, clothing reference benchmark and activity types based on ASHRAE Standard 9920 and ISO Standards 7730 (ISO7730, 2005; ISO9920, 2007). After excluding questionnaires with missing or uncorrected data, 667 valid questionnaires during the summer were obtained. Among all responses, there are 359 males and 308 females. We divide volunteers into four age groups: teenager (<18) youth (18–39), middle-aged (40–59) and elderly (≥60). We found that young people accounted for the highest ratio (62.1%), while the proportions of teenager (12.1%), middle-aged people (12.3%), and elderly people (13.5%) are relatively low. Due to the inability to find subjects with chronic diseases in a targeted way, the proportion of people with chronic diseases is low, with only 8.7%. The age distribution of people with chronic diseases covers almost all age groups, but 52% subjects with chronic disease was fall within the age group of over 60 year olds. The teenagers, youth, middle-aged, elderly in healthy subjects accounted for 13%, 65%, 12% and 10%, respectively. In the trials, sitting and walking are common outdoor activities, accounting for 41.1% and 35.7% respectively. The activity metabolic rate is 40–250 W/m². The clothing insulation values range from 0.25 to 0.83 clo and the mean value is 0.45 clo. The clothing insulation conditions for different genders, ages and physical conditions groups are shown in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that middle-aged and older respondents reported a slight high insulation than youngers in summer, but the difference was not significant. 2.3 Thermal indicators UTCI is a thermal indicator to determine outdoor thermal conditions under different climates (Jendritzky et al., 2012). It is developed based on multi-node “Fiala” model, which simulates human dynamic thermal response. To facilitate the wide-spread use of the UTCI, the simplified algorithm was provided in mathematical terms as follows (Bröde et al., 2012): (1) UTCI ( T a , T mrt , V a , RH ) = Ta + offset ( T a , T mrt , V a , RH ) Where, T a is air temperature, T mrt means radiant temperature, Va is wind speed, RH is relative humidity, offset refers to the deviation of UTCI from air temperature depends on air temperature, radiant temperature, wind speed and relative humidity. The software Bioklima® 2.6. (http://www.igipz.pan.pl/bioklima.html) was applied to calculate UTCI with input data of Ta, RH, V a at 10 m, and Tmrt . To reduce the sensitivity of wind speed variation, we used the 5-min average Ta, Va , and Tg to calculate T mrt . The mean radiation temperature was determined as follows: (2) T mrt = [ ( T g + 273 ) 4 + 1.10 × 10 8 V a 0.6 ε D 0.4 ( T g − T a ) ] 1 / 4 − 273 Where T g is the globe temperature (°C), Ta is the air temperature (°C), Va is the wind speed (m/s), ε and D is the globe emissivity (0.95) and the diameter of the globe-thermometer (0.15 m), respectively. Wind speed measured in 1.5 m was converted to Va at 10 m using Eq. (2), as required by the UTCI. (3) V 10 m = V x m × log ( 10 0.01 ) log ( x 0.01 ) Where, V 10m is the wind speed at 10 m, Vxm is the wind speed at x m; x is measured height (1.5 m in our study); 0.01 refers to the roughness length (m). The interviewees choose what was similar to what she/he was wearing in the questionnaire. The clothing insulation Icl was calculated according to the ISO 9920 (ISO9920, 2007). (4) I c l = 0.161 + 0.835 ∑ I c l u Where I c l u is the effective thermal insulation of the individual garments making up the ensemble (clo). Body movement affects the clothing insulation by air pumping. If M values was higher than 1.2 met, the calculation was adjusted by Eq.(4): (5) I C L = I C L A C T I V E × ( 0.6 + 0.4 / M ) 1.2 m e t < M < 2.0 m e t Where M is the metabolic rate expressed in met (1 met = 58 W/m2). It is not necessary to adjust the value of the clothing insulation when the metabolic rate was lower than 1.2 met. 2.4 Statistical analysis Thermal sensitivity is a comprehensive description of response to thermal environment, including thermal sensation, thermal comfort and thermal tolerance. We remove errors less than 2 responses in each interval to avoid outliers. Neutral temperature is defined as the temperature at which people feel neither cold nor hot (Cheung and Jim, 2018). Neutral temperature range (NTR) generally represents the ideal temperature range. The linear regression between the mean thermal sensation votes (MTSV) of respondents and UTCI at 1 °C intervals was fitted to generate neutral temperature and neutral temperature range. Neutral temperature was obtained by the UTCI value when MTSV is equal to 0, and neutral temperature range (NTR) is defined as the UTCI value range when MTSV between −0.5 and 0.5 in the regression equation (An et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Yin et al., 2021). The thermal tolerance range (TTR) represents the temperature range of 80% respondents voted acceptable. The quadratic curve was used to fit the relationship between UTCI and thermal unacceptance rate at 1 °C interval. The TTR is generally identified by the curve intersection when the acceptable rate is 80%. Thermal preference samples were divided into comfortable, uncomfortable and general thermal environment conditions through thermal comfort votes (TCV) for statistical analysis. A one-way ANOVA was conducted to explore the impacts of residential history, education level, economic level and city attractiveness on TSV, TCV and thermal acceptability. An independent samples t-test was used to compare the difference in respondents who living alone or not. 3 Results 3.1 Microclimate conditions The statistical microclimate variables are presented in Table 3 . The maximum outdoor temperature was 35.1 °C during the survey. The mean air temperature remained at around 28.7 °C in all sites. Average relative humidity in each minute changed inversely to average air temperature, with the ranges of 22.16% to 86.8%. The wind speed is between 0 and 3.59 m/s. The maximum and minimum globe temperature was 49.1 °C and 25.8 °C, respectively. Significant differences were noted for all sites. The investigation was hindered for two weeks by COVID-19 epidemic, we started survey again on August 20. The temperature in July was significantly higher than August. The highest mean air temperature was observed in pavilion space in July. The lowest mean air temperature was occurred in tree-lined street in August, and the temperature change was relatively high. The lowest mean globe temperature was registered at spaces with dense tree in July, because tree canopy could block most of solar radiation. The mean value of globe temperature in pavilion, building area and sunlit area were relative high, because they were more fully exposed to direct sunshine. The average wind speed near the water and building area were high and highly variable. The high value of mean relative humidity occurred at building area and spaces with dense tree. 3.2 Thermal sensation in different landscapes The distributions of outdoor thermal sensation votes in different landscape spaces in summer are presented in Fig. 4 . Spaces with dense tree had the highest neutral thermal sensation votes (37.9%), offering a pleasant thermal environment. The percentage of respondents feeling hot and very hot in building area was 31.6% higher than that in spaces with dense tree. In summer, the pavilion shade provides relative high extreme thermal sensation, due to the high expose of the selected pavilion. Thermal environment in waterside open space change least and provide a relative low thermal stress (TSV≥1) than pavilion. The most obvious reason is that the cooling effect of water and high wind speed improved the thermal conditions. Although the proportion of respondents reported hot and very hot (TSV≥2) in waterside open space was lower than that of spaces with dense tree, its heat stress ratio (TSV≥1) was greater than that of spaces with dense tree. In August, building area was hotter than tree-lined street. Sunlit spaces shows the thermal sensation between tree-lined street and building area, which may be due to the fact that the temperature was decreased and the people surveyed do not stay for a long time. 3.3 Individual factors affecting thermal sensitivity Male and female neutral UTCIs and unacceptable thresholds were calculated to explore the differences of the thermal sensation (Fig. 5 ). Line regression fitting was performed to identify the relationship of mean thermal sensation votes (MTSV) and UTCI. Neutral temperature is then calculated based on fitting formula. Neutral temperature of male and female was 26.6 °C and 27.0 °C, respectively, indicating the neutral temperature of males was slightly lower than females. The difference between the two slopes is not statistically significant (p > 0.05), indicating the response to temperature variation for females and males were similar. The NTR of female was narrow than male, especially in lower limit of range (Table 4 ). The regression lines of thermal unacceptable rates against the calculated UTCI were fitted for male and female to obtain TTR. The TTR of male was 16.8–33.6 °C, while female was 20.2–33.7 °C at 20% thermal unacceptability, revealing that female were more sensitive to low temperature. The heat acceptability of females was significantly lower than that of males when UTCI was higher than 33.9 °C. In order to assess the influence of age on thermal sensation during summer, we examined the relationship between the MTSV and UTCI values for teenager, youth, middle-aged and elderly (Fig. 6 ). Neutral temperature increased continuously with increasing age (teenagers 25.8 °C, youth 26.6 °C, middle-aged 27.7 °C and elderly 28 °C). Neutral temperature of middle-aged and older people was much higher than that of teenagers and youth, revealing that they has a higher optimum temperature. As age increases, the upper and lower limits of the NTR shift towards warmth. Quadratic regression fitting was performed for the UTCI and the unacceptable proportion of different age groups. The elderly exhibited an obvious difference with other three groups. The TTR width of older people was narrow and acceptable threshold of the elderly (33.2 °C) was 1.2 °C lower than young people (34.35 °C). The thermal unacceptance rate of the elderly was higher than that of the younger counterparts at all UTCI levels, and the unacceptable rate increase of youth was the slowest. People with common chronic disease, such as respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease and diabetes may affect their outdoor thermal perceptions. We plotted the relationships between UTCI value and MTSV of healthy group and chronic disease group (Fig. 7 ). Neutral temperature of people with chronic disease (27.5 °C) was higher than healthy people (26.8 °C). The slope for chronic patients appears to be steeper than healthy people, showing a higher sensation variation to outdoor thermal environment. When UTCI exceeded 32.1 °C, the MTSV of chronic patients was higher than those of healthy people. Healthy participants expressed a wider NTR than individuals with chronic disease. Chronic disease group had a narrow thermal acceptability range (18.9–34.0 °C) than healthy group (20.95–32.7 °C), with the upper threshold difference of 1.3 °C. After identical MTSV at 30.3 °C, the thermal unacceptability of chronic patients has risen rapidly. In terms of thermal preference, respondents mainly preferred cooler, dryer, stronger wind and weaker sun radiation in general and discomfort environment, while most prefer no change in comfort environment (Fig. 8 ). Males had a higher percentage of preferring cooler than females in comfort condition. When respondents feel general and uncomfortable, significant gender differences in preference of cooler were exhibited, especially up to 30% in uncomfortable conditions. In the survey, males prefer to adjust wind and humidity, and females are more sensitive to solar radiation. When feel uncomfortable, the proportion of chronic patients who want to be cooler and weaker sun radiation was higher than healthy ones. Chronic patients had a significantly high proportion for preferring stronger wind in general group (Fig. 8). In high temperature conditions, healthy respondents prefer dryer. Clear age differences were discernible in temperature, wind, humidity and sun radiation preferences in each comfort level groups (Fig. 8). Much as expected, a higher percentage of older people prefer cooler in discomfort condition, while a lower percentage of older people prefer cooler than other groups in comfort status. This is attributed to the slightly lower sensation of older people. In terms of wind preference, older people exhibited higher percentage for preference of stronger wind in discomfort condition, and there was slight preference difference in different age groups under comfortable conditions. Similarly, middle-aged and elderly prefer dryer than younger ones when they feel discomfort, while the opposite result in comfort conditions. When it comes to sun radiation preference, teenager and older people who perceived “Comfort” showed a lower percentage of preferring weaker sun radiation compared to the youth. 3.4 Social factors affecting thermal sensitivity To explore the effects of long-term thermal adaptation and psychological factors on thermal perception, we excluded the effect of thermal stress level. Two approaches are used for thermal stress classification: probit analysis and thermal acceptability approach. Probit analysis approach is based on the definition of ‘transition temperature’ (the temperature at which 50% of the subjects would change their thermal sensation votes) (Haghshenas et al., 2021). We determine the transition temperatures through the sigmoid response curves (Fig. 9 ). The intersection between TSV≥1 curve cross the 50% lines shows the transition from ‘neutral’ to ‘slightly warm’ which is occurring at 31.0 °C UTCI, TSV≥2 shows the transition points from ‘slightly warm’ to ‘hot’ at 38.4 °C UTCI, TSV≥2 from ‘hot’ to very hot’ at 41.1 °C UTCI. In addition, we divided heat stress levels as moderate heat stress, strong stress, very strong stress, and extreme stress corresponding to unacceptability rate of 40%, 60%, 80%, and >80%, respectively. Slight heat stress is lack in ‘Fiala’ model. We defined unacceptability rate of 15% as the lower limit of moderate heat stress. The classification types were moderate heat stress (32.4–36.6 °C), strong heat stress (36.6–38.9 °C), very strong heat stress 38.9–40.9 °C, and extreme heat stress (>40.9 °C). The two methods have similar classification results. Calibrated thermal stress classification in this study was compared with previous study (Table 5 ). We use thermal stress classification to eliminate the effect of temperature itself, and one-way ANOVA was conducted to identify the influence of thermal history characteristics on thermal sensitivity. There was no significant difference in MTSV between groups of residential time. Differently, mean thermal comfort vote (MTCV) of residents over 10 years (3.3) was higher than 1–5 years (3.01) and 5–10 years (2.92) in moderate stress. Although the difference was significant in very strong stress (p = 0.007), it was excluded from the analysis due to the small number of grouped samples. Similarly, significant difference of thermal sensation (F = 2.874, p = 0.023) and thermal comfort (F = 5.0, p = 0.001) for different education levels was observed in moderate stress, while no significant difference in strong stress (p = 0.15) and very strong stress group (p = 0.3). The post-hoc test showed that the MTSV of PhD respondents (1.77) was significant higher than those below high school (0.98), high school (1.05), university (1.08) and master (1.26) in moderate stress. Respondents below high school (3.43) had a higher MTCV than those with university (3.14), master (3.00), and PhD (2.46) degree in moderate stress, while the MTCV of doctoral respondents was significant lower than subjects with university degree and below (Fig. 10 ). Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in thermal sensation and thermal comfort across different income class in each thermal stress group. City attractiveness and whether to live alone were defined as psychological factors. Tamhane test showed that there was a significant difference in thermal status between respondents like or dislike local city in moderate stress (F = 4.072, p = 0.018). People who don't like local city have a higher MTSV (1.58) than those who like local city (0.98), indicating that a positive attitude reduces people's thermal sensation. Similarly, for thermal comfort, Tamhane test showed that attitude might significantly affect TCV. People who like local city are more comfortable than those who don't like local cityin moderate (p = 0.002), strong (p = 0.002) and very strong stress (p = 0.001) (Fig. 10). Whether to live alone has no significant difference under various thermal stresses. 4 Discussion 4.1 Comparison of thermal sensitivity with related studies This study found that female's neutral temperature (27.0 °C) was higher than that of male (26.6 °C), and other researchers have also observed this phenomenon (Indraganti et al., 2015). However, the gender difference of 0.4 °C was lower than the previous results (Cohen et al., 2019) (1 °C), in which the thermal index used is PET. The slope of fitting line for male and female was similar in this study, which was consist with the results of Cohen et al. (2019) and Lai et al. (2017). The TTR in our study was wider than a study in Wuhan (Huang et al., 2016), but it is worth noting that they applied a 90% acceptable rate, which was strictly than that in our study. Although we did not select winter samples, the lower limit was similar to other studies in Xian (He et al., 2020; Xu et al. (2019). It is noted that female showed lower cold tolerance in outdoor space (Jin et al., 2020; Shooshtarian & Ridley, 2016). Our fits showed consistent results. We confirmed that females had a clear preference of cooler in discomfort state, whereas females had a lower cooler preference than males in the comfort condition. Previous research stated that females are more likely to feel uncomfortable than males under non-neutral conditions (Ferraro et al., 2015), which further demonstrate the preference of cooler in discomfort environment. It can be explained by the fact that females usually have higher body fat, and their metabolic rate is often lower than males. Older people is generally considered as a vulnerable group. Climate in Beijing is similar to that in Xi'an, but TTR upper limit of old residents in this study (33.2 °C) was 7.3 °C higher than the results of Ma et al. (2021)) (25.9 °C), which may be caused by different analysis methods (acceptable rate of 90%, PET). The thermal acceptability range of older people was narrower than that of young adults, both during winter and summer (Huang et al., 2016; Hwang & Chen, 2010). Our study also exhibited that the elderly had a narrow TTR and low tolerance to high temperature. It is generally attributed to an impaired ability of thermoregulatory response (Hoof et al., 2017) and haemodynamic stability (Kenney et al., 2014). Older residents is likely to have a higher neutral temperature than younger counterparts, which is consistent with the results of Yao et al. (2022). Regarding to thermal preference, older people may prefer a warmer environment than youngers when fell comfort, which is similar to other studies (Schellen et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2016). The primary autonomic responses to heat stress is cutaneous vasodilation and sweat. Older adults have decreased metabolic rate (Larriva & Higueras, 2020), sweating activity and nerve conduction activity, leading to poorer ability to perceive temperature changes (Anand et al., 2022). Previous studies found no significant correlation between the physical weakness and thermal perception, thermal acceptability, and thermal preference (Soebarto et al., 2019). Inconsistent with their findings, we found that subjects with chronic disease display a lower tolerance to high temperature than healthy people. Recent studies found that thermal acceptability of patients differs from healthy people (Khalid et al., 2019). The frail wanted a neutral temperature of 0.3 °C ET* higher than that of the vigorous population (Hwang et al., 2007). The thermal preference analysis indicated that patients with thermal disease disorders prefer to be cooler than healthy individuals in discomfort and general heat conditions. This appears to be the immunity and resistance of individuals deteriorated by chronic diseases, such as respiratory diseases, kidney diseases, diabetes, and high blood pressures (Alotaibi et al., 2021). Previous findings showed that disease and disability affect human thermoregulatory responses, including sweating, shivering, and vasomotor control (Brik et al., 2021). Patients with chronic diseases are more susceptible to heat than healthy individuals (Abd Rahman et al., 2022; Khalid et al., 2019). For example, kidney disease leads to an imbalance of bodily fluid and electrolytes regulation in heat stress due to diminished kidney structure and function, accelerating physical illness. Patients with diabetes and hypertension impair body temperature regulation and cardiovascular function, which lead to cutaneous vasodilation attenuated during cardiovascular responses (Meade et al., 2020). Previous study stated that cardiovascular had the highest sensitivity to the outdoor thermal environment than those with diabetes (Ma et al., 2021). 4.2 Thermal adaptation and psychology influence Residential history is part of long-term climate acclimatization. It shows an impact between 32.4–38.6 °C, which is specifically reflected in that residents living for more than 10 years have higher comfort levels than other groups. Previous studies also found that this effect occurs in a similar thermal stress (Lam et al., 2021). Evidence supports that thermal adaptation has increased significantly during the first year of migration, and adaptation become slowly after one year (Luo et al., 2019). The longer the migrants stay in the local area, the closer their physical responses and thermal perceptions are to the locals (Luo et al., 2017). We found that thermal comfort level of respondents below high school was higher than that of master and doctor, and thermal sensation was significantly lower than doctor. The phenomenon can be explained by the long-term thermal adaptation due to the nature of work. People with low education usually do outdoor work or manual labor, while people with high education generally do mental work indoors. Whether liking local city have an influence on thermal sensation, thermal comfort and thermal tolerance in moderate stress, which is caused by psychological expectation. Existing evidence demonstrated that expectations and needs affects thermal perception, exemplified by reasons for access and thermal history (Yung et al., 2019). This study did not find the influence of economic class on thermal comfort. Inconsistently, previous study suggested that these economic classes have an effect on thermal sensation, thermal preference and satisfaction (Indraganti & Rao, 2010), but it is conducted in indoors. 4.3 Implications for mitigating heat risk and landscape design During the European heatwave of 2003, elderly (65 years) exhibits mortality of 40–100% increase, while little mortality occurs in the young group (<35 years) (Robine et al., 2008). Aging and increasing chronic rates, coupled with more frequent and intense heatwaves, a growing number of vulnerable people are at risk for heat-related illness and death. Long-term exposure to heat stress has adverse effects on population health. Spatial assessment of thermal stress risk can help identify areas of high thermal stress for planning preventive responses. This paper provides thermal stress classification which has meaningful practical significance to heat risk assessment. In addition, knowledge of thermal stress classification can help guide outdoor activities, such as reminding the public to spend less time outside during extreme heat. Vulnerability assessment in current risk assessment framework is based on the vulnerability factors we consider and they are assigned equal weights. The difference in tolerance thresholds of different populations in this study can be used as the weight of vulnerability assessment. In addition, the results provide valuable insights for urban planning and design of outdoor open spaces which can improve living environment. This study concluded that green infrastructure reduced the percentage of people perceived strong thermal sensation, improving thermal comfort. Designing outdoor spaces considering the thermal sensitivity characteristics of different groups helps to improve the outdoor experience. Cities or regions with severe aging and chronic diseases rates have relatively low thermal tolerance. Addition of hospitals in areas with high percentage of chronic disease can reduce risk under high temperatures. For example, areas with dense elderly need to set more shades and transition zone from indoor to outdoor to reduce extreme heat exposure and increase the elderly's communication and interaction. Designing diverse thermal environments may be reasonable for areas with a large number of people who works in office. It is suggested that encouraging people indoors for a long time to strengthen their adaptation by undertaking different kinds of outdoor activities. 4.4 Limitations This study investigated the thermal state of subjects covers various crowd and multiple sites with different landscape features, representing a reliable thermal benchmark during summer. However, several limitations are still existed in our study. First, since people who willing to fill out the questionnaire are often not exposed to the sun, there is a lack of respondents on exposure to high radiation, especially the elderly. Unfortunately, the respondents who were able to participate in this field study excluded groups with limited mobility. Moreover, within the respondents, chronic disease condition were not evaluated in detail. In the future research, it is suggested to explore the influence of different disease condition on thermal sensitivity. Second, short-term thermal expose is proved to be the influence factors on thermal perception and acceptability. Cheung and Jim (2019) demonstrating that the transient acceptability overestimated the comfort level through applying the 1-hour acceptability (Cheung & Jim, 2019). The interaction influence between long-term thermal history and short-term heat exposure needs to be resolved in the future. Last, standardized survey response scale was a future direction. Recent research suggests using a multi-dimensional scale to evaluate thermal comfort, rather than a one-dimensional thermal sensation scale. A further study should add emotional dimensions (e.g., thermal pleasure and thermal intensity) to improve the thermal sensation framework. 5 Conclusions This study conducted a cross-sectional survey to examine the influence of individual characteristic, long-term adaptation, and psychological factors on thermal responses and identify the sensitive population associated with summer extreme heat. The following conclusions could be drawn: (1) People perceived less thermal stress in spaces with dense tree, while building area had the highest strong thermal sensation with 31.6% difference. (2) Although there was little gender difference for thermal tolerance upper limit, the lower limit of male was significantly lower than female. The elderly showed a lower tolerance than younger with 1.2 °C difference. The upper TTR threshold of healthy people was 1.3 °C higher than those chronic disease counterparts. (3) Older people has a higher neutral temperature than young people. Thermal preference proves that female and older people like warmer than their counterparts in a comfortable state. (4) People with long-term residency had a higher MTCV than residents less than 1 year, showing a thermal adaptation. People who like local city had a higher TCV and lower TSV than those dislike the city. Our study has contribution to understand the thermal comfort requirements of different people and provides information for urban planning and design. Future exploration of multidimensional scale of thermal sensation expression could extend the human thermal stress assessment. Understanding the interactive response of long-term and short-term adaptation would facilitate urban planner to create comfort environment. Thermal response of patients with different disease should be collected to reveal its sensitivity to heat. More vegetation, artificial shading, and transition areas from indoor to outdoor are recommended for elderly and diverse thermal conditions should be create to facilitate people who sit in office for a long time during each day.
