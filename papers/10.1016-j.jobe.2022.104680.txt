Globally, the population is ageing and extreme weather scenarios are expected, especially in southern European countries. In this context, the study assessed the thermal comfort of older people in five nursing homes in a continental Mediterranean climate in Spain during summer, through environmental measurements and surveys on site. A total of 1412 people were interviewed, including residents (older people) and non-residents (adults). The results showed that under the same environmental conditions, adults felt that the environment was warmer and they were less tolerant than older people. There was a 2.4 °C difference between the neutral temperature of older people (25.6 °C) and adults (23.2 °C). Older people were less sensitive to thermal changes and their comfort zone was wider than that of adults. The comparison with similar studies from other climatic zones concluded that the neutral temperature for elderly in different climatic zones is similar but the thermal comfort zones are different. Older people were less sensitive to temperature changes than the predicted mean vote (PMV) model predicted. Therefore, this model would not be suitable for older people in cooling conditions in the Mediterranean continental climate. These results could be a starting point for the development of more accurate, healthy indoor spaces that meet the needs of older people as a vulnerable group, while improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions.

International policies have focused on improving the building environment for ageing societies, to gain more years of health and wellbeing [1]. In Spain, 20% and 6% of the population correspond to people over 65 and 80 years old respectively. These figures are forecast to increase in the next few years [2]. As a result, demand for assisted living and residential homes is increasing and the indoor environmental quality and energy efficiency implications may need to be considered [3,4]. As older people spend most of their time indoors [5], focusing on protecting the health of older people and improving energy efficiency would also bring economic benefits for society [6]. Extreme weather events are predicted to increase due to climate change. More frequent high-temperature events such as heatwaves are expected and will mainly affect southern European countries [7]. The most vulnerable groups like older people would be most affected [8]. This has been evidenced in past events like the 2003 heatwave in England, where the excess mortality of people over 75 rose 33%, compared to a 13.5% rise among younger people [9]. Similarly, around 600 people, three-quarters of whom were over the age of 65, died in Chicago's 1995 heat wave [10]. Increasing global temperatures in the context of an ageing population is a public health concern [11]. With age, some physiological aspects decrease like muscle strength, sweating rate, the ability to transport heat to the skin, hydration levels, vascular reactivity and cardiovascular stability [12,13]. In other words, older people have reduced thermoregulation capacity, combined with a decrease in the ability to detect changes in their body temperature. This makes them more vulnerable to extreme climate scenarios [13,14]. Fig. 1 represents the main climatic zones in Europe. Most southern countries correspond to a Mediterranean climate according to the greatest widely used climate classification, the Köppen-Geiger [15,16]. There are four prevailing climatic zones in Europe: Csa (Mediterranean climate, temperate with dry and hot summer); Cfb (Oceanic climate, mild cool winters and humid mild summers); Dfb (Eastern humid continental climate, warm summer) and Dfc (Subarctic climate, long and cold winters and cold summer). These are divided into other sub climates. Most southern European countries, including Spain, correspond to the Csa climate. International commitments, like the Paris Climate Conference from 2015 to 2030, have been made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [17]. Buildings are responsible for 36% of greenhouse gas emissions and one of the European Union's objectives is to reduce these emissions by 90% by 2050 [18]. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are one of the main elements responsible for building consumption and emissions, and thermal comfort is directly implicated in this [19,20]. Thermal comfort is one of the most important factors for indoor environmental quality. It affects human health and energy efficiency [6,20–22]. Approximately 75% of heating and cooling is generated by fossil fuels, according to Eurostat [23]. Therefore, decreasing energy demand for HVAC is important for the European decarbonization policy. The European Cooling Index (ECI) has been developed to analyze the geographical distribution of cooling demands in Europe [24]. It is based on the cooling degree days (CDD) concept, which refers to the assumed point from which consumers need to use the cooling system in a space. It depends on the number of degrees per day that the daily temperature is above a normal temperature (22 °C) [25]. The need for cooling buildings in 2020 was double that of 1979 and Spain ranks fifth among the countries with the highest cooling degree days after Malta, Cyprus, Portugal and Greece [26], most of which are southern countries (Fig. 2 ). The most commonly used HVAC design standards, such as ASHRAE 55 [27] and ISO 7730 [28], are mainly focused on the characteristics of average young people (male, 35 years old, 1.70 m tall, weight 75 kg, normal level of clothing and standard metabolic rate) and may not fit the physiological needs of older people [4,29–34]. Thermal perception is a complex issue. Many factors, including physiological, physical (behaviour) and psychological factors, influence each person's perception and adaptation apart from environmental conditions [35,36]. Most of these factors differ between older and younger people [37]. Past studies have assessed physiological changes in thermal environments. Novieto and Zhang [13] found that heart rate, metabolic rate and weight in older subjects differed between 10 and 19.2% from younger ones. They stated that metabolic rate had the greatest influence on thermal comfort. Schellen et al. [34] found that the skin and body temperature of older adults was lower than that of younger people and that this had a significant effect on thermal comfort. In the last few years, there have been many studies on thermal comfort in older people, and some have assessed thermal comfort in nursing homes [30,38–43] and older peoples’ homes [44–48]. However, there is still a gap in knowledge on thermal comfort temperature for specific climatic zones, type of building and user. Some authors have found differences in thermal perception between older adults and younger ones [49]. This is mainly because thermal sensitivity decreases with age as a consequence of some physiological changes such as a reduction in muscle strength, sweating, heat transport capacity to the skin, hydration levels, vascular reactivity and cardiovascular stability [4,12,13,49,50]. A study by Krüger et al. [51,52] found that younger adults were more sensitive than older ones in Curitiba Brazil. Studies by Hwang et al. [44] and Wong et al. [39] in Korea determined that older people perceived the environment as colder. Tartarini et al. [38] in Australia found that residents had a higher thermal sensation than non-residents in nursing homes. However, only a few studies about indoor thermal comfort in summer in the Mediterranean climate (Csa) consider older people [11,53–55]. Hansen et al. [11] reported higher morbidity in older women and people with chronic health conditions during heatwaves in Australia and stated that older people are adapted to heat extremes and undertake appropriate adaptive behaviours. Giamalaki and Kolokotsa [55] focused on older people's thermal comfort in their own homes in Greece and found that they prefer a warmer thermal environment in winter and cooler in summer. Bills et al. [53,54,56] studied older people's homes in Australia and found more of a preference for cooler conditions than that considered by ASHRAE and they determined that older people were more sensitive to heat. No studies have been reported on older people's thermal comfort in the continental Mediterranean climate. Cities need to adapt their buildings to an ageing population and to climate change. However, it remains unclear to what extent air conditioning standards and regulations are applicable to buildings occupied by elderly people in each climatic zone. The effectiveness of these standards needs to be investigated so that a more energy efficient setpoint temperature can be applied if possible, for the well-being of all occupants. Existing studies recognize the need to develop thermal comfort standards for each climatic zone and different users. Most of those studies found that the PMV model was unsuitable for older people in different climatic zones. This study compares its results with past research findings in different climatic zones to identify differences in thermal perception that could be related to climate adaptation, cultural and social factors in each study context. Given the above, the objectives of this study were to: a) evaluate the thermal comfort of the elderly by identifying their neutral temperature and thermal comfort zone in the continental Mediterranean climate in the cooling season; b) compare the thermal comfort of elderly people (residents of nursing homes) and adults (non-residents); c) compare the thermal comfort of elderly people from the continental Mediterranean climate in the cooling season and other climates; d) check whether the PMV model is suitable for older people in the continental Mediterranean climate. 2 Methodology 2.1 Continental Mediterranean climate description Continental Mediterranean is a temperate climate with a dry and hot summer (Csa-c). It is characterized by low average relative humidity of 37%, an average temperature of 25–32.8 °C and maximums that exceed 35 °C in summer, in contrast with moderate-high humidity in winter that reaches maximums of 71%, average temperatures of 2–11 °C and minimums below -2 °C. The daily thermal oscillation presents amplitudes of up to 16 °C in summer and around 6.9 °C in winter [57,58]. 2.2 Experimental campaign: fieldwork An experimental campaign was conducted in five nursing homes in the Madrid Region, in Las Rozas, Alcobendas, Colmenar Viejo and Madrid in Spain. Fig. 3 presents the location of each nursing home. Field measurements were made over three days in each centre during the months of June, July, and August 2021 (Table 1 presents the exact dates of the measurements in each nursing home) (see Fig. 4). Environmental measurements and surveys were performed simultaneously in common areas (living room, therapy room, dining room and gym-physiotherapy room). After 10 min of equipment stabilization, measurements were recorded every 15 s for periods between 15 and 60 min, depending on the activity and number of people in each room, and between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. as this was when occupancy was highest and most activities were carried out. Table 1 presents the main characteristics of the nursing homes and their rooms. 2.2.1 Environmental measurements In this research, objective on-site measurements of indoor environmental parameters (Tg, Ta, RH, Va) were made according to ASHRAE 55, ISO 7730 and ISO 7726 [27,28,59]. The characteristics of the equipment used for this purpose are presented in Table 2 (Fig. 5 ). The equipment was located at a central point in each assessed room, at 1.5 m above ground. Some other variables like operative temperature (Top) and running mean temperature (Trm) were calculated by the following formulas (1 and 2) respectively [30,59,60]. (1) Top=(Ta + Tr)/2 (2) Trm= (Ted-1+0.8 Ted-2+0.6 Ted-3+0.5 Ted-4)/2.9 Where Ta is the air temperature and Tr is the mean radiant temperature, calculated using the globe temperature (Tg) measured by a black globe thermometer, according to ISO 7726 standard [59]. Ted-n refers to the 4-day weighted running mean of outdoor temperature. The outdoor environment was also considered in this study. Dry temperature (Tout) and relative humidity (RHout) data were collected from the weather stations closest to each nursing home. Fig. 3 presents the location and Table 3 some information about these weather stations. 2.2.2 Thermal perception assessment Considering that the population over 65 years living in nursing homes in the Community of Madrid is 322,180 people [61], the minimum representative sample with a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error of 5% is 365 [62]. This study included a sample of 1232 people. At the same time as the environmental parameters were measured, nursing occupants were surveyed to determine their thermal sensation (TSV), preference (P) and degree of acceptability (A). A customized right-here-right-now survey was employed to collect subjective comfort evaluations from building occupants during the 3-month monitoring period in the common building zones. Thermal perception was assessed through a questionnaire survey to older people (residents) and adults (non-residents such as centre staff including therapists, nurses and assistants), consisting of three simple Likert scale questions: for the thermal sensation vote (TSV), the ASHRAE seven-point scale was used (−3 cold, −2 cool, −1 slightly cool, 0 neutral, +1 slightly warm, +2 warm, +3 hot) [27]. For thermal preference (P), a three-point scale was used (−1 cooler, 0 without change, +1 warmer) and for thermal acceptability (A), a two-option question (1 acceptable, 0 unacceptable) was used. Some personal variables were collected by observation, such as gender, level of clothing (clo) and metabolic rate (met, according to the activity). Table 4 presents the clothing insulation level for each item and Table 5 shows the standardized metabolic rate for typical activities performed at nursing homes during the experimental campaign, based on ISO7730 [28] and ASHRAE 55 [27]. 2.3 Statistical analysis The statistical analysis was carried out using Spearman's and Pearson's correlation test. Linear regressions and the chi-square test were performed using IBM SPSS 22 software at a significance level of 0.05, to assess the relationships between thermal perception and environmental and personal variables. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Outdoor and indoor environmental conditions During the experimental campaign, the outdoor temperature ranged from 15.2 °C to 29.3 °C with an average of 23.4 °C. Relative humidity ranged from 16.9% to 83.7% with an average of 44.6%. The experimental campaign was carried out under conditions that are characteristic of a continental-Mediterranean climate. The average indoor environmental conditions during the experimental campaign were Ta = 25 °C, Tg = 25 °C, RH = 44%, va = 0.1 m/s. Table 6 presents the outdoor and indoor environmental conditions during the study. 3.2 Sample description Five nursing homes in Las Rozas, Alcobendas, Colmenar Viejo and Madrid in the Community of Madrid, Spain, were selected. A total of 1412 surveys were collected during the experimental campaign in the summer, 87.3% were older people (residents, most of them over 65 years old), 12.7% were younger adults (non-residents, nursing home staff). Regarding the gender of participants, 78% of the general sample were women. Women represented 75.5% of residents and 93.3% of non-residents. Nursing homes staff helped to select participants with good cognitive function for inclusion in the study. 3.3 Thermal sensation residents and non-residents Chi-square tests revealed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between thermal sensation votes (TSV) of residents and non-residents in cooling conditions in nursing homes (Table 7 ). No significant differences were found according to the gender of the participant (p > 0.05). Even though there was a big difference between the groups, the comparison between groups may not be representative but just indicative. Regarding older people's thermal sensation, 78% perceived the environment as neutral (TSV = 0); 77.2% stated they would not change it and 90% thought it was acceptable. Under the same conditions, 58% of non-residents had a neutral thermal sensation, 61.7% would not change it and 86.7% felt it was acceptable. Adults considered that the environment was warmer than the older people: 19.44% felt the environment was slightly warm (TSV = 1), 7.78% warm (TSV = 2) and 10.56% hot (TSV = 3). This coincides with the figure of 35.6% of adults who would prefer the environment to be cooler, in contrast with 12.3% of residents who would prefer it to be warmer. Fig. 6 presents these results by type of user. Schellen et al. [34] found that the thermal sensation of older adults was in general 0.5 scale units lower than that of younger adults. Similar results were found by the Forcada et al. [30] in their study in nursing homes in the Mediterranean climate on the eastern coast of Spain, where residents were more tolerant than non-residents. Nevertheless, in that context, only 13.3% of non-residents had a neutral thermal sensation while 67% felt the environment was hot (TSV = +1; +2 and + 3). Spearman's correlation test was performed to assess the correlation between thermal sensation vote (TSV) (ordinal variable) and the environmental parameters (as numerical variables). The results revealed that thermal sensation was strongly correlated (p < 0.01) with indoor environmental variables like Top and Tr for older people and adults. 3.3.1 Neutral temperature and comfort zone Through linear regression, the neutral temperature (Tn) was calculated for older people and adults as a function of their mean thermal sensation votes (MTSV) and the operative temperature (Top) with weighted 0.5 °C binned data [63–67] (Equations (3) and (4)). Fig. 7 represents these linear regressions. The neutral temperature was found to be 25.6 °C for older people and 23.2 °C for adults, with a very high difference of 2.4 °C between them. The slope of the TSV of older people is lower. This means that they are less sensitive to thermal changes and thermal changes may affect adults more, as some other studies have found [30,38,68,69]. Some authors attributed this to the influence of the reduction in their thermal sensitivity and regulation [3,47]. However, other factors such as origin, expectation, previous experience and exposure time to a thermal environment may influence each person's subjective perception [49,70]. This could be related to thermal adaptation, as residents spend most of their day indoors, while non-residents enter and leave the residence every day [71]. (3) Older people MTSV = 0.15569Top-4.0227 (R2 = 0.6) (4) Adults MTSV = 0.356 Top-8.2524 (R2 = 0.5) The thermal comfort zone is defined by ASHRAE [27]as the range of temperature where at least 80% of users are satisfied with the thermal environment. ASHRAE suggests a special category of 90% for older people [27,60]. As in the present study, 90% of older people and 86.7% of adults found the environment acceptable (Fig. 6). The thermal comfort zone will be considered within the interval of TSV = −1 to 1, as in other studies [39,44,53,72–74]. Based on linear regression models (Equations (3) and (4)), the comfort zone for older people was found to be from 19.4 °C to 32.3 °C, while for adults it was from 20.4 °C to 26 °C. The comfort zone for adults was narrower than that of older people. The results reported that temperatures up to 32.3 °C may still be comfortable for most older adults. However, some authors suggested that these high temperatures may be risky for health [6,75]. A bibliographic review by Tham et al. [75] found that indoor temperatures higher than 26 °C were associated with increased respiratory distress emergencies, and symptoms of dementia were significantly exacerbated. This means that even if older people feel that the environment is pleasant, their health may be at risk without them noticing [6]. Both the neutral temperatures and the comfort zone vary in studies in other climatic regions. Although the methodology used to define these limits differs in all the referenced studies, in the present study the range has been extrapolated from the linear regression between TSV and Top, considering TSV (−1 to +1) as satisfied. This method is the most common in most thermal comfort studies [39,44,53,72–74]. Some studies [30,44] define this range by a second order polynomial best fit regression to estimate the percentage of dissatisfied people (PPD) in response to the change in Top, and others use psychrometric charts [76] or other statistical models [41]. Some authors have reported that there is no consensus on these charts and models. This could lead to misconceptions, since there are no guidelines on how levels and ranges should be defined and determined, and significant variations in methods and terms exist in the literature [44,77]. For the sake of comparison, we obtained the temperature ranges according to the methodology in the present study, using the logistic regression of each study and interpolating TSV values between −1 and 1. Table 8 presents this comparison between the present study and others from different climatic zones for the summer or cooling season. Neutral temperature results from the present study were similar to those of the study performed in nursing homes in the Mediterranean climate (Csa-m) in the coastal region of Spain, under cooling conditions [30], where Tn was found to be 25.3 °C for residents and 23.9 °C for non-residents but within a narrower thermal comfort zone for residents from 22 °C to 29.2 °C. However, these results are very different to those of a study in Australia, which corresponds to a Csa climate [46]. In a Cwa climate (humid subtropical climate), Hwang & Chen [44] found neutral temperature to range from 22.6 °C to 27.8 °C for older people in summer in private dwellings. In a Cfb climate (oceanic climate), Tartarini et al. [38] found a wider comfort zone range from 16.9 °C to 29 °C in nursing homes. Nevertheless, Loughnan et al. [45] found that most older people stated that they were thermally comfortable at a temperature of 26.6 °C in dwellings. In Dwa (humid continental climate) in Korea, Yang et al. [41] analysed thermal comfort by clusters. By linear regression, they found a neutral temperature of 23.9 °C and a thermal comfort zone range from 22.15 to 25.6 °C for older people. Considering that the thermal comfort zone is calculated by the regression between MTSV and Top, the differences among thermal comfort zones in different climatic regions might be attributed to different sensitivity to temperature changes due to adaptation to climate and tolerance [78,79], cultural variables [22,70,78,80], origin or health level within different climatic regions. For the present study the comfort zone is broader than for the other studies indicating that elderly people from the continental Mediterranean climate have a low sensitivity to temperature changes and allow broader temperatures. However, the neutral temperature was found to be similar for all elderly people in different regions. This result allows determining a common setpoint temperature for all nursing homes but defining different margin of acceptability by climatic region. 3.4 Influence of personal variables on thermal sensation Metabolic rate varies according to the activity performed (met), and this, together with the level of clothing, are considered personal factors that affect the perception of thermal comfort and adaptation to the environment [81]. Statistical differences were found between older people and adults for met and clo (T-student test) (p < 0.01). Table 9 presents the level of activity (met) and clothing insulation. The results showed that met was higher for adults, as most of the time older people performed passive activities, some were restricted by their health status [11], and many had mobility difficulties. Older people wore higher levels of clothing than adults, which could also be attributed to thermal sensitivity loss. These results are consistent with those of other studies that found older people wear higher levels of clothing insulation in general [51,56]. Some authors have found that older people tend to adjust their clothing levels as their main adaptative behaviour to the thermal environment in residential environments [44,82]. This might be the only possible adaptive behaviour in environments like nursing homes where residents cannot control the air conditioning or windows [83,84]. Spearman's correlation test was performed to assess the correlation between thermal sensation vote (TSV) (ordinal variable) and personal variables (clo and met, as numerical variables). The results revealed that thermal sensation was only correlated to activity and to the level of clothing in older people (p < 0.01). Thermal sensation was negatively correlated with the level of clothing in older people (r = −0127). In other words, when older people wore higher levels of clothing, they felt warmer. This coincided with the results of Forcada et al. [30]. Some authors stated that most TSV differences between age groups are related to a lower activity level that implies lower metabolic heat production in the elderly [34,85]. Clearly, it is important to find other adaptative behavioural solutions for older people to improve their thermal comfort and overall health in environments like nursing homes where they do not have control of air conditioning or windows. For example, they could use small handheld fans, cooling pads, blankets, etc. The level of clothing was significantly correlated to indoor environmental variables like RH and Va, and to the outdoor temperature (Tout) for older people. For adults, neither clothing nor activity was related to environmental variables. Similarly, the level of activity of older people was found to be correlated to indoor environmental variables like Top and outdoor variables like the RHext. For adults, there was no correlation. Linear regression was calculated to find the relation between level of clothing with indoor operative temperature (Top) for both groups (Equations (5) and (6)). (5) Older people Mclo = 0.0131Top+1.0117 (6) Adults Mclo = −0.0105Top+0.7191 Fig. 8 presents these regression models. The results indicate that both older people and adults adjust their clothing levels related to Top more than Trm. When Top increased, the Clo level decreased, even though this influence was low compared to other studies [30,38,44]. Additionally, through the Pearson correlation test, the level of clothing (clo) was not correlated with activity (met) for older people or for adults (p > 0.05). All of them maintained their level of clothing independently from the activity. In contrast, in the study of Forcada et al. [30], only younger adults adapted their clothing to the activity that was performed. Other authors found that older people's most popular strategy of thermal adaptation is clothing adjustment [44,82]. Residence staff kept the same level of clothing most of the day as it corresponded to their uniform or standard working clothes, without much possibility of adaptation in the case of high temperatures. Other clothing materials or lighter garments should be considered for them, as it has been seen that younger adults have a greater sensation of heat and less satisfaction with the thermal environment, which could affect their health and work performance. Some older adults have mobility impairment, which may make it hard for them to add or remove clothing by themselves. Table 10 compares these results with similar studies for other climatic zones. Clothing insulation was higher for older people than for younger adults in all studies. The highest values occur in the Cwa climate (0.70) [76], followed by the present study (0.65). The metabolic activity was similar for all these studies. 3.5 Evaluation of the suitability of the predicted mean vote (PMV) for older people in a continental Mediterranean climate The applicability of the PMV model was analysed for older people in a continental climate with cooled indoor environments. PMV was calculated according to ASHRAE 55 [27]. It is a heat-balanced model based on experimental studies [81]. It depends on the characteristics of the environment like the dry air temperature (Ta), mean radiant temperature (Tr), air velocity (Va) and relative humidity (RH) and occupants’ characteristics such as activity level (met) and level of clothing (clo). This index is the most commonly used and recognized by international standards and regulations [27,28,60], even though it overlooks factors such as climate, psychological, physiological and behavioural adaptation [86] and was developed to test on young students [4,87]. In the present study, the mean PMV was −0.13 for residents while for non-residents it was 0.5. In a study on the influence of thermal comfort on the quality of life of nursing home residents, Mendes et al. [43] found that values of PMV above −0.7 had a higher mean score for quality of life. They highlighted the importance of these results for public health policies. Linear regression between PMV and Top was performed to compare it with MTSV (Equation (7)), this is presented in Fig. 9 . (7) Older people PMV = 0.3463 Top- 8.6736 (R2 = 0.95) The neutral temperature according to PMV for older people was 25 °C while that obtained experimentally by TSV was 26 °C; there is a 1 °C difference between them. The slope was lower for the MTSV model so older people would be less sensitive to temperature changes than the PMV model predicted, as some other studies have found [30,38,41,42,48,68,76]. Hughes et al. [48] also found that the PMV model was not suitable to predict the thermal comfort of older adults in the southwest of the United Kingdom (Cfb climate). In this case, PMV also predicted colder sensations than observed in older people. Forcada et al. [30] and Yang et al. [41] found lower neutral temperatures with the PMV model and a higher slope than that obtained by TSV. Older people felt comfortable in wider ranges and were less thermally sensitive than the PMV model predicted. Wu et al. [42] attributed these results to differences in health status between young and older participants. Some authors suggest that special thermal comfort standards should be developed according to older people's characteristics [29–32]. Table 11 compares results from this study with other similar studies in other climatic zones. In all of them, PMV had lower values than TSV for residents and a higher slope. The results show that the PMV thermal comfort model was not suitable in cooling conditions in the Mediterranean continental climate for older people. This result is in agreement with Tartarini et al. [38] who stated that the PMV index was not a precise predictor of thermal state for nursing homes residents in Cfb (Oceanic climate) climate in Australia. This study had some limitations that were out of the authors’ control. The sample group did not have equal proportions between residents and non-residents or between women and men. In nursing homes, there are always fewer therapists and caregivers than residents and more women than men. Therefore, the proportion in whatever study will be similar to that presented in this analysis. Another limitation relates to the analysis of physiological characteristics. The present study has not considered physiological measurements (like blood pressure, sweat rate, heart rate, skin and core temperature), psychological (expectations) and demographic factors (origin, economic, studies, etc.), although previous studies found that these factors influence thermal adaptability and perception. Future studies might consider these variables to identify those that have the greatest influence on older people's thermal perception. As thermal perception is a complex system [35,88] that is affected not only by environmental variables, some authors stated that new adaptative thermal comfort approaches are required. Salata et al. [4] highlighted the need to find adaptative models that consider clinical and psychological needs of older people according to each climatic area. De Dear et al. [89] reviewed a hypothesis of using the concept of Alliesthesia to asses thermal comfort. Differentiating between thermal pleasure, thermal acceptability and neutrality, this encourages the exploration of alternative modes of heat transfer within the build environment and occupants based on skin and core temperatures. 4 Conclusions This study assessed the thermal comfort of older people (residents) in nursing homes in the continental Mediterranean climate and compared it with the thermal comfort of younger adults (non-residents). The following conclusions were drawn. • Regarding thermal sensation, under the same environmental conditions, adults felt the environment was warmer and were less tolerant than older people. • Statistical differences between thermal sensation for older people and younger adults were found and this was reflected in 2.4 °C of difference in neutral temperature (25.6 °C for older people; 23.2 °C for adults). The results affirm that older people were less sensitive to thermal changes. Many authors attribute this to the physiological changes that occur with age, which make them more vulnerable to thermal extremes that could cause dehydration, hypothermia and hyperthermia, among other health effects, which may be unnoticed. • The comfort zone of older people was wider than that of adults. It was found to be between 19.4 °C and 32.3 °C. • A comparison with similar studies from other climatic zones confirmed the differences in thermal comfort zones attributed to the climate and cultural variables that influence thermal acceptability and adaptation. However, the neutral temperature was found to be similar in most studies (between 25.2 and 25.9). • Clothing insulation and the level of activity were related to the thermal sensation of older people, who wore higher levels of clothing and had lower levels of activity than adults. This coincides with most similar studies. • The applicability of the PMV model was analysed for the case of older people in continental climate cooled indoor environments. The results suggest that older people would be less sensitive to temperature changes than the PMV model predicted as some other studies have found. Therefore, this model would not be suitable for older people in cooling conditions in the Mediterranean continental climate. In the context of the ageing population trend, more research is needed to determine mitigation and adaptation strategies for the extreme climate scenarios to come, including the correct design of buildings such as nursing homes. These results could be a starting point for the development of more accurate, healthy indoor spaces that meet the needs of older people as a vulnerable group, while improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions.
