Box 39040, Tel Aviv, Israel. Department of Geography and the Human Environment Tel Aviv University P.O. Box 39040 Tel Aviv Israel Editor: Scott C. Sheridan Since the early 2000's, much attention has been paid to human thermal assessment in urban outdoor environments in different climatic zones. Some previous studies have argued that an absence of an agreed protocol for outdoor human bio-meteorological research causes complexity in comparing the studies' results for several reasons: An abundance of human thermal indices, a variety of interpretations of bio-meteorological terms, an array of procedures for data collection and a lack of agreed methods in determining thermal comfort ranges and index modifications. This study aims to review strategies and methods for human bio-meteorological research and to examine their suitability for thermal perception assessment. From 2001 to 2021, 254 case studies assessed human thermal perception by investigating in-situ thermal conditions versus subjective thermal perception, relying on protocols such as ASHRAE Standard 55 and EN ISO 10551 that were originally developed for indoor environments. Fifty-four cases determined different ranges for thermal comfort. Although 43 studies tried to modify indices to various climatic zones, only 13 studies modified the nine PET physiological stress categories and 4 studies modified the ten UTCI stress categories). Thus, comparisons between the studies' results become complicated. Our review points to three main reasons for the complexity: first, the 7-point TSV scales, does not always fit the scales of the applied thermal index; second, measurement procedures do not always represent the local climate conditions; third, certain methods for modifying thermal index scale thresholds are not capable of modifying the entire index scale. On the basis of our findings, we suggest a framework for bio-meteorological research, with attention to measurement procedure, appropriate questionnaire design, careful data control and suitable methods to enable modification of thermal indices. This study recommends applying systematic and objective statistical methods like linear regression and discriminant analysis in order to successfully modify the entire index scale.

In the 20th century, human biometeorology was acknowledged as a natural science based on human energy balance models and quantitative statistical methods (Höppe, 1997; Blażejczyk, 2011; McGregor, 2012). The assessment of human thermal comfort has become a burgeoning field in biometeorology due to growing concern about global environmental changes (McGregor, 2012) and since the early 2000's, much attention has been dedicated to human thermal comfort in outdoor environments as a new field of biometeorology (Nikolopoulou et al., 2001; Givoni et al., 2003). However, guidelines for assessing outdoor human thermal comfort are based upon the ASHRAE standard 55 (1966, 1974, 1992, 2004, 2010) which was intended for the indoor environment (Spagnolo and de Dear, 2003; Liu et al., 2020), while the definition of an outdoor comfort range and the methods to define it have remained ambiguous (Cheung and Jim, 2017). In this context, the most commonly used outdoor human thermal sensation vote based on the Predict Mean Vote (PMV), which was originally intend for indoors by Fanger (1972), and has been shown to be inaccurate in predicting outdoor human thermal sensation (Nikolopoulou et al., 2001; Becker et al., 2003). In the 20th century, adjustment of outdoor human thermal indices was based on experiments in climatic chambers and calculations of human energy balance (Blazejczyk et al., 2012; Fiala et al., 2012: Enescu, 2017). Later, there was a necessity to modify indices to local climate conditions and they were adapted to different geographical locations and modified for cultural behavior. For example, the Discomfort Index (DI) which was developed by Thom and Bosen (1959) in US, have been modified for the Israel by Sohar et al. (1963) using a climatic chamber. The Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) was introduced by Mayer and Höppe (1987) and adjusted to Middle-Western Europe, based on energy balance by Matzarakis et al. (1999), who pointed out that changes in the thermal environment may require adaptation of the original PET scale. Since beginning of the 21th century, evaluation of human thermal indices by subjective perception has become a conventional methodical tool for assessment human thermal comfort in different climatic condition (Johansson et al., 2014; Potchter et al., 2018; Shooshtarian, 2019). Spagnolo and de Dear (2003) were the first to modify threshold limit values of five thermal indices for Sydney, Australia. Since then, various studies have aimed to modify scales to different climatic zones (Antonini et al., 2020; Banerjee and Chattopadhyay, 2020; Binarti et al., 2020; Kumar and Sharma, 2020). This trend of modifying human thermal indices to diverse climatic zones has become an integral part of contemporary bio-meteorological research (Johansson et al., 2014; Pantavou et al., 2018; Potchter et al., 2018; Binarti et al., 2020; Shooshtarian et al., 2020). However, there is no agreed framework or protocol for outdoor human thermal perception assessment (Cheung and Jim, 2017; Elnabawi and Hamza, 2020; Mi et al., 2020; Kenawy and Elkadi, 2021). Pervious review articles have argued that this absence of agreed protocol causes complexity in comparing the studies' results for several reasons: (a) An abundance of human thermal indices (Johansson et al., 2014; Pantavou et al., 2014; de Freitas and Grigorieva, 2017) (b) Differences in bio-meteorological terminology (Cheung and Jim, 2017; Charalampopoulos, 2020) (c) A variety of procedures for meteorological data collection e.g., seasonality, time and duration of measurements and site selection (Johansson et al., 2014; Cheung and Jim, 2017) (d) A diversity of field survey strategies (Johansson et al., 2014; Salata et al., 2016) and (e) A lack of agreed methods in determining human thermal comfort ranges and indices scale modifications (Kántor et al., 2016; Cheung and Jim, 2017; Hadianpour et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2019; Mi et al., 2020; Kenawy and Elkadi, 2021). Consequently, it has been suggested that despite the plethora of thermal perception studies it is difficult to compare the studies' results and guidelines for human thermal perception assessment are required (Johansson et al., 2014; Cheung and Jim, 2017; Potchter et al., 2018; Staiger et al., 2019; Shooshtarian et al., 2020). This study aims to (a) review the different strategies, techniques and methods for human bio-meteorological research, (b) examine the suitability of different methodologies for thermal perception assessment (c) introduce a basic framework for thermal perception assessment, and (d) suggest a protocol for data monitoring procedures, data analysis and indices modification methods. Hopefully, this will lead to a better understanding of human thermal adaptation to different climate zones in an era of expected global warming. 2 Methodological approach This study comprises three stages: first, a comprehensive literature review of articles which examine human thermal perception in the outdoor environment by field meteorological measurements and questionnaire surveys. Second, a comparison of data analysis methods and techniques for human thermal perception assessment. Third, a suggested framework and protocol for human thermal perception research. 2.1 Stage I: a literature review The systematic literature review included peer-reviewed journal articles in English since 2001, which combined in-situ micrometeorological measurements with subjective thermal perception obtained by questionnaires. The aim of the review was to identify techniques for human thermal perception assessment, definition of thermal sensation benchmarks and modification methods for thermal indices scale thresholds. The review based on the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analysis (Liberati et al., 2009; Page et al., 2021) and the guidelines for systematic review in environmental fields (Pullin and Stewart, 2006) The review used five major data sources: Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, the Wiley Online Library and Water Resource Abstracts (ProQuest). The following keywords were used: thermal perception, outdoor thermal comfort, thermal comfort assessment, human thermal index, neutral temperatures, thermal acceptable range, index modification, thermal benchmarks. An overviewing of the articles enabled the identification of data collection techniques, field survey strategies, procedures for thermal acceptable range determination, neutral temperature range definition designation and index scale modification methods. 2.2 Stage II: comparison of data analysis methods and techniques The diverse techniques and methods used in human bio-meteorological research were classified according to key definition terms, benchmarks and outcomes. Data analysis and data synthesis were conducted as follows: survey strategies, techniques, and methods were extracted from the studies. Then thresholds of the most commonly used indices were analyzed in relation to climatic zones according to applied modification method and a comparison of the perceived threshold was undertaken. 2.3 Stage III: advocating protocol for human bio-meteorological research A basic framework for thermal perception assessment is introduced, suggesting protocol for monitoring procedures, methods for data analysis and indices modification techniques, aiming to create viable common denominators for comparing the studies' results. 3 Results 3.1 Overview of studies Following the application of the approach described in Section 2.1, a systematic literature review identified 194 peer-reviewed articles which investigated in-situ thermal conditions versus subjective thermal perception during the years 2001–2021. A review of these studies revealed the complexity in comparing the studies' results and consequently, in providing comprehensive understanding regarding human thermal perception for several reasons: 3.1.1 An abundance of human thermal indices Previous studies indicated that out of 165 existing human thermal indices, only a few were originally intended to determine thermal sensation in outdoor environments and found to be applicable (Epstein and Moran, 2006; Potchter et al., 2018; Staiger et al., 2019). An analysis of the 194 reviewed articles, found 295 case studies, which applied 59 indices. PET, Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), PMV and Standard Effective Temperature (SET*), were applied in more than 10 case studies (Table 1 ). Temperature humidity index (THI)/DI and Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) were applied in 8 case studied, Operative Temperature (OpT/TOP) in 7, OUT_SET* and Thermal Sensation (TS), have been applied in 6 case studies. 3.1.2 Differences in human bio-meteorological terminology One of the fundamental problems in human-biometeorology is the multiple definitions of terms. The basic terminology relied on ASHRAE Standard 55 (1966, 1974, 1992, 2004, 2010)). Later, The Commission for Thermal Physiology of the International Union of Physiological Sciences (2003), introduced a glossary of terms for thermal physiology. Gosling et al. (2014) have published a glossary of bio-meteorological terms aimed at addressing the need for a reliable set of definitions for common bio-meteorological terms. However, an overview of recent studies shows a lack of uniformity for common terms still exists. Two terms are usually used to describe human comfort (ASHRAE Standard 55, 2004, 2010); The first, “human thermal comfort” defined as the state of mind which expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment. The second, “thermal acceptable range” defined as an environment that a substantial majority of the people would find thermally acceptable. The ASHRAE Standard 55 (2004) specifies that acceptable thermal conditions must be acceptable to a minimum 90% of subjects when a high standard is applied, and 80% acceptability under typical applications. The term “neutral” is defined as the condition at which people feel neither cool nor warm (Fanger, 1972), corresponding with a mean vote of “neutral” on the thermal sensation scale. Many studies assume that “human thermal comfort” and “thermal acceptable range” are the same domain when modifying the ‘neutral’ class in the indices scale (Cheung and Jim, 2017). Nevertheless, each human thermal index uses different terminology to determine the term “thermal comfort”, e.g.; TSV (Thermal Sensation Vote) PMV and PET as “Neutral”, PT and UTCI as “No thermal stress” etc. (Table 2 ). Moreover, in some studies the term “thermal comfort range” or “neutral temperature range” is exchangeable with the term “thermal acceptable range”, (e.g. Lin and Matzarakis, 2008; Yahia and Johansson, 2013; Yang et al., 2013b; Xu et al., 2019) and can lead to inaccuracies and misunderstandings. Another issue is the use of inappropriate terminology, such as “comfortable temperature range of the PET” instead of “neutral range” or “acceptable range of dry-bulb temperature (−0.5 < TSV < +0.5)” (Jeong et al., 2016). Inaccurate terminology can be widely found in the scale definition of indices. For example, “neutral range” of UTCI (Hadianpour et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019; He et al., 2020) instead of “No thermal stress”. It should be noted that the range of 9–26 °C was defined as “No thermal stress”, and the range of 18–26 °C was defined as a subinterval of UTCI thermal comfort zone (Błażejczyk et al., 2010). 3.1.3 A variety of procedures for meteorological data collection The overview of the studies showed a variety of meteorological data collection procedures such as investigation season, duration, time of experiments, site selection and monitoring tools (Table 3 ). Not all the studies cover the annual thermal conditions. Some studies miss the significant season, like winter in cold climates (Yang et al., 2017; Kántor et al., 2012). Other studies concentrated on one season; the cold season (i.e. Yang et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018) or hot season (i.e. Becker et al., 2003; Yin et al., 2012; Johansson et al., 2018) and some studies investigated extreme conditions such as heat waves (Lam et al., 2018a). Duration and time of the experiment vary from study to study. The majority of the studies lasted several hours during the day, some studies covered only the morning and midday hours (da Silva and de Alvarez, 2015), while only a few studies lasted for several consecutive days and 24 h a day (Becker et al., 2003; Cohen et al., 2013; Cohen et al., 2019). As for site selection, some studies investigated one type of urban outdoor environment e.g. park (Mahamoud, 2011; Lam et al., 2018a, 2018b; Xu et al., 2019), square (Lin, 2009), university campus (Shooshtarian and Rajagopalan, 2017), or street canyon (Elnabawi et al., 2016). Monitoring tools vary too from one study to another. Some studies applied data from official monitoring stations in the vicinity of the research unit (Lin and Matzarakis, 2008). Most of studies applied fixed weather station data but use devices with different sensors’ quality (calibration status, accuracy, threshold values, resolution etc), e.g. Campbell (Cohen et al., 2013, 2019), HOBO (Krüger et al., 2020), or the Davis station (Elnabawi et al., 2016). Some studies applied a mix of Campbell weather stations and the Kestrel Heat Stress Tracker 4400 (Lam et al., 2018a, 2018b), or a mix of HOBO for air temperature and relative humidity, Kestrel 5500 for wind velocity and Delta OHM HD2107.2 for Globe temperature (He et al., 2020; Mi et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). This variety of procedures for meteorological data collection neither accurately represents the actual thermal environment nor does it reflect actual human exposure to it. 3.1.4 The diversity of field survey strategies for human thermal perception An overview of the field studies showed a variety of strategies for questionnaire design and questionnaire point scales, target populations, sampling methods and sampling size. The protocol for investigating outdoor human thermal perception is based on structured interview questionnaires of ASHRAE Standard 55 (1992) which were originally intended for the indoor environment aiming to match the 7-point scale of Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) (McIntyre, 1980; de Dear and Fountain, 1994). This one-dimensional descriptive scale which has been extensively used in outdoor thermal comfort research, has certain shortcomings in outdoor settings (Liu et al., 2020). The use of indices intended for indoor environment for outdoors required an adjustment of the original ASHRAE 7-point scale to the stress category of each index (Table 2). This led to modification of the 7-point scale of the PMV to a 9-point scale in order to fit PT and PET indices stress categories. However, the 9-point scale does not correspond with the 10 stress categories of the UTCI, the 8 categories of SET*/OUT_SET* and the 5 categories of WBGT. Numerus studies have applied the ASHRAE 7-point scale although they used the PET index of 9 strain and stress categories (e.g: da Silva and de Alvarez, 2015; da Silveira Hirashima et al., 2016; Lucchese et al., 2016; Salata et al., 2016; Shooshtarian and Ridley, 2016(. In other cases, researchers applied the 7-point or 9-point ASHRAE scale for SET*/OUT_SET* which contain 8 stress categories (e.g. Hwang and Lin, 2007; Lin et al., 2011; Shimazaki et al., 2011; Pantavou et al., 2013a; Xi et al., 2012; Gobo et al., 2018) and for UTCI which contains 10 stress categories (e.g. Pantavou et al., 2013b; Krüger et al., 2017; Hadianpour et al., 2018; Xu et al., 2019; Krüger et al., 2020). Some studies used the 5-point scale for modifying indices categories of 7 stress categories like PMV, 8 categories like OUT_SET* or 9 categories like PET (Tsitoura et al., 2014; Ruiz and Correa, 2015). Other studies made inconsistent use of the thermal comfort vote, using one scale for the winter and another scale for the summer (e.g. Brychkov et al., 2018). A recent study of Chen et al. (2020), used the 11-point scale questionnaire but modified the scale of 10 stress categories for PET (instead of the original 9 categories) and 10 categories for SET* (instead of the original 8 categories). Inconsistencies between the questionnaire scale and the index scale can lead to gaps in index modification scales, for example; PET thresholds of “cool” and “warm” categories are missing in Campo Grande, Brazil ( Lucchese et al., 2016) and in Vitoria, Brazil (da Silva and de Alvarez, 2015), PET thresholds of extremely hot and extremely cold categories are missing in Athens, Greece (Pantavou et al., 2014) and the thresholds of “slightly hot” and “slightly cold” were excluded in Konya, Turkey (Canan et al., 2020). Numerous studies pointed out that different investigated populations can perceive the thermal environment differently: e.g.; tourists vs. local residents (Rutty and Scott, 2015; Lam et al., 2018a), temporary residents vs. local native residents (Brychkov et al., 2018; He et al., 2020) and immigrants vs. native-born (Kenawy and Elkadi, 2018; Shooshtariana and Ridley, 2016; Kurazumi et al., 2016). Therefore, factors such as origin of birth, ethnic, cultural and thermal background must be included in the questionnaires. Two sampling methods are commonly used in thermal perception studies; longitudinal and transvers. The longitudinal approach is based on the convenience of sampling where a group of subjects are consistently exposed to the thermal environment and vote at constant time intervals throughout the survey period and provide large numbers of votes accordingly. (e.g., Becker et al., 2003; Brode et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2012; Salata et al., 2016). The transvers approach is based on random sampling where passers-by are interviewed only once during the survey period (e.g., Nikolopoulou et al., 2001; Spagnolo and de Dear, 2003; Lin and Matzarakis, 2008). The advantage of a longitudinal approach is a better control of subjects' gender, ethnicity, clothing, activity, age and thermal history. The disadvantages are the limited number and homogeneousness of subjects, who do not necessarily represent a cross section of the population. In addition, the subjects can develop a bias towards expected research outcomes. The advantage of the transvers approach is the large size of sampling which could better represent the whole population. The disadvantage is the difficulty of controlling activity, metabolism, age and thermal history and the availability of subjects in the survey period (Liebert and Liebert, 1995; Knez and Thorsson, 2006; Salata et al., 2016; He et al., 2020). The sampling size depends on the study's approach and on the target population. An overview of the studies showed that the transvers method comprises a smaller number of subjects, between 6 and 112, whereas longitudinal method comprises larger numbers of subjects, between dozens to thousands (Salata et al., 2016). This raises the question of how large the sampling size should be in order to achieve a reliable representation of the investigated population. Johansson et al. (2014), suggested that the sampling sizes for the longitudinal method should range between 400 and 500 responders. 3.1.5 A lack of uniformity of methods in the determination of a “comfort range” An overview of the studies shows that different methodologies have been used for modifying and determining human thermal comfort range (Table 4 ). Two main approaches can be found; a determination of the annual comfort range per se and determination of the comfort range as part of entire scale modification. Fifty-four of the reviewed case studies modified the “thermal comfort range” to the local climate, using one or more different methods; Linear Regression (LR), Discernment Analysis (DA), Relative Frequency (RF), Probit Analysis (PA), Ordinal Logistic Regression (OLR), Cubic Regression (CR), Quadratic Fitted Curve (QFC), Percentage of Dissatisfaction (PD) and percentage of Thermal Acceptability Range (TAR). The LR method based on bind MTSV that varies between ±1, ±0.85 and ±0.5. The TAR methods based on percentage of acceptability varies between 80, 85, 88 and 90%. Overall 16 different methods for defining the comfort range were found, while some of the studies determined two or more indices. Forty-four studies used the PET “neutral” range, 17 studies used the UTCI “no thermal stress” range, 5 studies used the SET*/OUT_SET* “comfortable” range and 3 studies used the WBGT “no danger” range. Thus, the divergent methods that were used to determine the “range of human thermal comfort” make comparisons between the results complicated. 3.1.6 A lack of uniformity in methods for indices full scale modifications Forty-seven of the studies modified annual scale of thermal indices to various climatic zones. Initial adjustments of PET, based on energy balance, were applied to Middle-Western Europe by Matzarakis and Mayer (1996) and Matzarakis et al. (1999) who pointed out that changes in the thermal environment may require adaptation of the original scale. In 2008, Lin and Matzarakis first modified the PET scale for the sub-tropical climate of Sun Moon Lake, Taiwan, by using thermal sensation questionnaires based on the ASHRAE 55 scale (1995). Following, 25 studies similarly modified the PET scale to other climatic zones (Table 5 ). The UTCI was first introduced by Błażejczyk et al. (2010) and designed to predict average human thermo-physiological sensations in a wide range of climatic conditions. In 2013, Pantavou et al., first modified the UTCI scale to the Mediterranean climate of Athens, Greece. Following, 11 studies similarly modified the UTCI scale to a variety of climatic zones (Table 5). Other indices were hardly modified; The SET*/OUT_SET* were modified by four studies and the WBGT has been modified by two studies since 2014. 3.2 Comparison of data analysis methods and techniques The inconsistency in human bio-meteorological studies data collection and analysis as well as the multiplicity of methods for thermal index modifications, makes the comparison between the study's results challenging. The following section presents a comprehensive comparison of worldwide thermal perception from two angles; the thermal comfort range and the index full scales. 3.2.1 Comparison of thermal comfort range in different climatic zone Seventy-two attempts were made to adjust the annual “thermal comfort range” to the local climate, using a range of methods. Only the PET and the UTCI were used in a sufficient number of case studies to allow comparison of the output. Originally, the PET “neutral” range of 18–23 °C was determined by Matzarakis and Mayer (1996) for Midwest Europe and then modified for various climatic zones by 41 later case studies, using 7 different methods; 19 case studies used LR, 3 DA, 3 PA, 3 OLR, 2 RF, TAR and 2 as Percentages of Dissatisfied (PD). Fig. 1 exhibits the modified PET “neutral” ranges in different climatic zones according to the applied methods. The comparison clearly shows that the “neutral” range shifts towards lower threshold adequacy with the outdoor falling temperatures. The PET “neutral” range is wider when outdoor thermal conditions become lower or when the amplitude between summer and winter increases. These trends are most pronounced when the PET “neutral” range is determined by linear regression. Originally, the range of 9–26 °C for UTCI was determined as “No thermal stress” by Błażejczyk et al. (2010) and was related to human physiological responses to thermal stress. The UTCI “no thermal stress” range for various climatic zones was determined by 18 case studies using 4 different methods; 9 case studies used LR, 3 PA, 1 CR and 3 as a percentage of thermal acceptability. Fig. 2 exhibits the modified UTCI “no thermal stress” ranges in different climatic zones according to the analysis methods. The comparison clearly shows that the range of 21 to 25 °C UTCI is common to all climatic zones. However, none of the modified ranges fits the UTCI “no thermal stress” category which was originally determined for a large variety of climate zones. The range does not necessarily shift towards lower threshold adequacy with the outdoor falling temperatures. It should be noted that the number of case studies is not large enough to reach categorical conclusions. In order to compare the PET “neutral” and UTCI “no thermal stress” ranges in different climatic zones, the relations between the determined range and the local outdoor thermal conditions were examined according to the following criteria: (a) The relation between the lower threshold limit of comfort range and the average minimum temperatures of the coldest month, and (b) The relation between the upper threshold limit of PET “neutral” and UTCI “no thermal stress” and the average maximum temperatures of the hottest month. These relations where analyzed at four levels; (1) all methods, (2) linear regression, (3) 50% probit analysis and (4) thermal acceptability and percentage of dissatisfaction (Fig. 3 ). A comparison of the slope, correlation and significance of these relations reveals a few insights (Table 6 and Fig. 3): When examining each method solely it seems that the LR presents the strongest, positive, correlative and significant relation in comparison to the other modification methods (PA, PD and TAR). When comparing the relation for all methods together and for LR it seems that for lower limit of comfort range vs. the average minimum temperatures of the coldest month both indices, PET and UTCI, shows strong positive, correlative and significant relation. When comparing the relation between the upper limit of comfort range vs. the average maximum temperatures of the hottest month, the PET shows better correlative and significant relation than the UTCI. The main outcomes of Table 6 are that the PET “neutral” range exhibits better adaptations to the ambient thermal conditions than the UTCI “no thermal stress” ranges. However, the UTCI is more sensitive towards cold conditions than the PET and agree with the findings of Chen et al. (2020). The additional complexity of using multi-methods to define thermal comfort range can be observed when comparing comfort range for the same city. Three forms of comparison can be seen in the reviewed studies: The first form, determining thermal comfort by different studies using different methods showed different comfort ranges in the same city. For example, In Melbourne, Shooshtarian and Rajagopalan (2017) defined the neutral PET range as 19–23 °C using 50% PA, whereas Kenawy and Elkadi (2018) defined it as 17.5 °C–23.2 °C using −0.5 ≤ TSV ≤ +0.5 in LR and 20–25 °C using 90% acceptability. In Hong Kong, Morakinyo et al. (2017) defined the neutral PET range as 25–29 °C using 85% acceptability, whereas Cheung and Jim (2018) defined it as 18.9–31.6 °C by 50% PA (Fig. 1). The second form, determining thermal comfort range using the same methods based on different data set exhibited dissimilar results. For example, in Xi'an, UTCI “no thermal stress” range was defined using 80% acceptability as 18–29.1 °C by Xu et al. (2019) and as 15.8–28.5 °C by He et al. (2020) (Fig. 2). In Harbin, PET neutral range was defined using 50% PA as 8.5–26.8 °C by Chen et al. (2020) and 13–21 °C by Yin et al. (2021) (Fig. 4 ). The third form, determining thermal comfort using different methods based on the same data set, exhibited dissimilar results as well. For example, in Athens the UTCI “no thermal stress” defined as 16.8–24.5 °C by PA and as 20.0–24.4 °C by LR (Pantavou et al., 2014). In Harbin, the PET “neutral” range defined as 13–16 °C, by DA and as 8.5–26.8 °C by LR (Chen et al., 2018, 2020) (Fig. 4). The above comparison of defining thermal comfort range by different methods raises the question about which method can best predict the thermal comfort range. Matzarakis and Mayer (1996) were the first to relate the PMV “Comfortable” range of −0.5 and 0.5, originally intended for indoor, to the outdoor “neutral” range of PET. Consequently, since 2013, studies determined the range that corresponded to −0.5 < TSV < 0.5 as comfort range by applying a simple linear regression (Kruger 2013a; Lai et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016). 28 studies defined PET “neutral” range and UTCI “no thermal” stress range by LR, which has become the most commonly applied method in the field (Table 4) and is well correlated with the thermal environment (Fig. 3b and f). Thus, despite the controversial assumption that the neutral range is a linear scale rather than ordinal scale (Cheung and Jim, 2017; Matzarakis, 2020). Another commonly used method which was applied to determine the comfort range is the Thermal Acceptable Range (TAR), assuming that it is equivalent to the PET “neutral range” (e.g. Lin and Matzarakis, 2008; Kenawy and Elkadi, 2018; Mi et al., 2020), UTCI “no thermal stress” (e.g. Pantavou et al., 2013b; He et al., 2020), WBGT “no danger range” (e.g. Pantavou et al., 2020a, 2020b) and SET* “comfortable zone” (e.g. Yahia and Johansson, 2013). According to ASHRAE Standard 55 (2004), the percentages of the acceptable thermal range must be at a minimum of 90% when a high standard is applied and 80% acceptability in typical applications. An overview of the studies shows that the use of acceptability percentage applied in the research is not consistent. For example, 6 out of the 12 PET studies used 90%, 4 used 88%, 2 used 85% and 3 used 80% (see Table 4). A comparison between the different studies can be done only when based on the identical acceptability percentage. Moreover, a comparison between LR and TAR shows that each method is based on a different criteria procedure; ±0.5 MTSV for LR and -1, 0, 1 bind MTSV for TAR (Kenawy and Elkadi, 2018; Cohen et al., 2019). The present study demonstrates that the relation between PET “neutral range” determined by 88–90% acceptability and the outdoor thermal conditions shows a weak and insignificant correlation, as opposed to these relations when applying LR (Fig. 3d). These findings support the argument of Cheung and Jim (2017) that the “acceptable range” and “neutral/comfort range” lie in different domains and it is inappropriate to use these two terms interchangeably. The 50% probit analysis (PA) method was initially used to determine the outdoor neutral range by Spagnolo and de Dear (2003) based on the responder's cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Since then it has been used only in another 4 case studies for determining PET “neutral” range, 4 case studies to determine UTCI “no stress” and one case study to determine SET* “comfortable” range. In most of these cases, the 50% PA was used as a method to modified the entire index stress categories and has not been used to determine the “neutral” range alone. The PET “neutral” range which determined by this method is well correlated with the thermal outdoor environment (Fig. 3b) whereas the UTCI “no stress” range is poorly correlated (Fig. 3f). However, these results are not clear cut due to the limited number of case studies. All the other methods to determine thermal comfort range, such as CR, OLR, RF, and DA were used by 3 case studies or less (Table 4). Therefore, it is still difficult to evaluate their suitability for bio-meteorological research. 3.2.2 Comparison of scale indices modifications in different climatic zone The indices scales were usually designed to express the level of thermal sensation in the thermal conditions of its developer's climatic region, like the temperate climate of mid-western Europe and Australia (PET, UTCI, SET*/OUT_SET*) and the hot climates of Untied State (THI/DI. WBGT). Hence, their validity and applicability outside the region for which they were first developed has been questioned (Cheung and Jim, 2017; Potchter et al., 2018). So far, 36 attempts made to modify the indices annual entire scale to regional climatic conditions for PET, UTCI, SET*/OUT_SET* and WBGT, using 8 different methods (Table 5). SET*/OUT_SET* and WBGT were not used in sufficient case studies to allow a valid comparison. The PET annual entire scale was modified for various climatic zones in 26 case studies by 6 different methods (LR, TAR, DM, PA, ORL and RF). Thirteen case studies modified entire scale of stress categories (Singapore and Kuala Lumpur are exception since the cold stress categories could not be classified due to the hot tropical climate) (Table 7 a). Three cases used DA, 3 LR and 1 PA, all based on 9-point or 11-point scale questionnaires, and 6 cases used TAR based on a 7-point scale questionnaire. Another 13 case studies present a partial modification, used 5 and 7-point scale questionnaires (Table 7b), led the researcher to skip stress categories (e.g. Canan et al., 2020), or not to scale the extreme stress categories (“very hot” and “very cold”) (e.g. Tsitoura et al., 2014; Shooshtarian and Rajagopalan, 2017). The 10 case studies that modified UTCI entire stress scale, were conducted in 3 climatic zones; 4 for Athens (Csa), 3 for Xian (Cwa/BSk), 2 for Harbin (Dwa) and 1 for Tianjin (Dwa). Four methods were applied for these modifications; 3 studies used TAR, 3 PA, 3 LR and one CR. All the studies used the 7-point questionnaire, except Harbin where the 11-point questionnaire was used. Only 4 studies modified entire stress categories, 3 studies used TAR and one study, in Tianjin, integrated between TAR and LR (Lai et al., 2014b) (Table 8 ). Examination of the relations between lower and upper thresholds and the local thermal conditions for 27 PET and 11 UTCI modified case studies showed the following: The relation between the average minimum temperatures of the coldest month with a perceived lower boundary for PET is strong, positive (slope of 0.7857), correlative (R2 = 0.7804) and significant (p = 0.000), and for the UTCI is less strong, positive (slope of 0.3913) and less correlative (R2 = 0.5061) but significant (p = 0.014). the average maximum temperatures of the hottest month with a perceived upper boundary for PET is slightly negative, very weak (slope of −0.0562), not correlative (R2 = 0.0109) and not significant (p = 0.414), and for the UTCI is negative (slope of −0.2127), not correlative (R2 = 0.3726) and not significant (p = 0.46) (Fig. 5a and b). It seems that the relations between the thermal conditions and the PET scale thresholds are stronger, more correlative and more significant than for the UTCI scale thresholds (the bias might be due to the wider sampling size). This trend is more pronounce in the upper threshold and shows better adaption of PET scale to hot conditions than the UTCI scale. The main insights that can be drawn based on the 36 attempts that were made to modify the PET and UTCI scale are: Only 16 (46%) case of studies managed to modify full scale categories. The most used method to modify full scale index categories is the TAR. The second most used method to modify indices full scale categories is the LR and the DA. The CR, RF, OLR and multi LR did not succeed to modify full scale categories. It seems that except for the TAR, other methods are not capable of defining the UTCI scale, since these studies have used the 7 or 11-point scale, which do not match the 10 stress categories of UTCI. Additional complexity of using multi-methods to modify indices scale can be observed when comparing case studies conducted in the same city. Three forms of comparison can be seen in the reviewed studies: The first, scale modification by different methods demonstrates dissimilar thresholds. For example, in Melbourne, Shooshtarian and Rajagopalan (2017) modified PET scale by PA to seven categories whereas Kenawy and Elkadi (2018) modified PET scale by TAR to nine categories (Fig. 6a). The second comparison is studies using different modification methods for an identical data set (Pantavou et al., 2013a, 2014; Chen et al., 2018, 2020; Xu et al., 2019), showed dissimilar thresholds for entire scale ranges. In Harbin, the PET was modified by 3 different methods. Only modification by DA presents the entier 9 scale categories. Modification by LR classified 7 categories from “very cold” up to “warm” and modification by PA classified 8 categories from “very cold” up to “hot” (Chen et al., 2018, 2020). In Athens, the UTCI was modified by four different methods. Only modification by thermal acceptability presents the 9 scale categories. Modification by LR, PA and CR classified 6 stress categories from “strong cold stress” up to “very strong heat stress” (Pantavou et al., 2013b, 2014) (Fig. 6b). The third comparison is that scale modification by different studies using the same methods exhibited different outcomes. For example, in Xi'an, Xu et al. (2019) and He et al. (2020), modified UTCI full scale and applied thermal acceptability but presented dissimilar thresholds (Fig. 6b). It seems that different methods for index modifications can provide different thresholds, which raises the question which method can best predict the thresholds for each stress category? The advantages and drawbacks of the methods used to modify the PET/UTCI scales were first discussed by Cheung and Jim (2017). However, there is a need to re-examine these methods in a wider perspective (Table 9 ). Complete modifications of thermal indices were successfully performed by applying TAR, LR and DA methods. Thermal acceptability is the most commonly used method that has been used to modify indices entier scale. Out of 11 attempts, 9 have modified indices entier scale (6 for PET and 3 for UTCI) according to its original scale (Tables 7 and 8). However, the criteria for defining “neutral” or “no stress” categories is based on arbitrary percentages (90, 88, 85 or 80% acceptability) and on arbitrary temperature increments or arbitrary percentages that rely on the researcher's experience and interpretation rather than an objective statistical approach. Only three case studies have used exactly the same criteria in similar climatic regions (hot and humid), so a comparison between different climatic areas is impossible. The linear regression is the second commonly used modification methods with 10 modification attempts. 3 PET and 1 UTCI cases have modified the entier scale based on a 9-point questionnaire or more. The discriminate analysis method allows a complete scale modification if the TSV data covering all 9 classes in PET or 10 classes in UTCI (Cheung and Jim, 2017). So far three attempts to modify full PET scale were made and all of them were successful. Probit analysis was recommended by Ballantyne et al. (1977) as an appropriate technique for modification of the thermal indices entierl scale, with the limitation that it can grade 6 transition categories using a 7-point scale questionnaire. Nine attempts were made to modify index scale by PA (5 for PET and 4 for UTCI), only one case study modified PET 9 scale categories using an 11-point questionnaire (Yin et al., 2021). Studies that used ordinal logistic regression, cubic regression, multi-linear regression and relative frequency methods were unable to yield the complete modification. In summary, the number of case studies that have succeeded in modifying the entier scale of thermal indices is still too small for a meaningful comparison of human thermal perception in different climatic zones. Further research with a uniform protocol is required. 4 Discussions Numerous studies have tried to quantify human thermal perception in outdoor urban environments worldwide. In the absence of an agreed protocol for outdoor bio-meteorological research, scholars have used a variety of methods to define human thermal comfort range and l stress thresholds relying on protocols such as ASHRAE 55 and EN ISO 10551 that were originally developed for indoor (Cheung and Jim, 2017; Potchter et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2020). Consequently, the current study aims to introduce a basic framework for outdoor human thermal perception assessment and to advocate a protocol for bio-meteorological research. 4.1 The complexity in conducting outdoor bio-meteorological research A systematic literature review of 194 peer-reviewed articles which assessed subjective thermal perception between 2001 and 2021 highlights three main reasons for this difficulty: first, the questionnaire design; second, measurement procedure (site, season, time and duration); third, the methods for modifying thermal comfort range and scale category thresholds. In addition, two important reasons that were not discussed in this review and can lead to inaccuracy of the data analysis are data control and Tmrt calculation. The TSV scales used in the studies' questionnaires varied from 5. to 7, to 9 and 11-point scales. Consequently, the 5 or 7-point TSV scales do not cover the nine categories of PET, the eight categories of SET* or the ten categories of the UTCI. Therefore, the use of non-uniform TSV scales, which do not fit the index categories, causes difficulties in index modification. Inconsistency of measurement procedure (site, season, time and duration) and measurement tools may cause difficulty when comparing results across the studies. Only a limited number of studies collected meteorological data that represent both, hot and cold seasons, for many hours throughout the day, in varied urban thermal environments (Cheng et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2013, 2019). The abundance of methods for modifying thermal comfort range and stress categories thresholds make the comparison between modification outcomes very challenging. When comparing modified PET “neutral” range for different climatic zones, only 19 out of 54 studies, which applied linear regression method can be examined using a common denominator. Whereas, a comparison of PET “neutral” range of studies applying other methods is meaningless, due to a small numbers of case studies. A comparison of studies which managed to modified the entire stress categories is even more challenging. From 25 studies that have tried to modify a complete PET scale, only 13 managed to grade all stress categories. From 10 studies that have tried to modify a complete UTCI scale, only 4 managed to grade all stress categories. Thus making comparison impossible. Data quality control is essential in processing such a large amount of collected data by questionnaires. In some papers the relation between TSV and PET is doubtful. For example, Galindo and Hermida (2018) reported a TSV -2 for outdoor conditions of 52 °C PET and TSV -3 for 43 °C PET: It seems that either the respondents did not understand the question or the surveyor did not understand the answer (like a scribal error such as writing (−) instead of (+). Moreover, if the sampling group is small, one wrong vote can bias the MTSV, which can lead to an incorrect trend line between MTSV and PET values. A possible inaccuracy can be caused by Tmrt calculation, since some common software under estimate the Tmrt while others over estimate it (Cohen et al., 2020). The above discussion points to the complexities which face researchers when assessing human thermal comfort in the outdoor environment. 4.2 Advocating protocol for bio-meteorological research Recent review studies on outdoor human thermal perception have pointed out the need for an agreed framework for bio-meteorological research (Johansson et al., 2014; Cheung and Jim, 2017; Antonini et al., 2020; Elnabawi and Hamza, 2020; Lai et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020, 2021). The basic framework for thermal perception assessment suggested by de Dear and Fountain (1994) and De Dear and Brager (2001) for indoor studies, was applied later for outdoor studies by Nikolopoulou et al. (2001), Ahmed (2003) Givoni et al. (2003). Spagnolo and de Dear (2003) were the first to develop basic protocol for outdoor thermal comfort assessment. Lin and Matzarakis (2008) were the first to modify the PET original thermal scale to the hot humid climate of Taiwan, based on the de Dear and Fountain (1994) framework. Since then numerous studies have modified human thermal indices in different climatic zones. The guidelines for conducting outdoor bio-meteorological research and determining thermal benchmarks rely on the indoor approach and have certain weaknesses when applied to the outdoor environment (Cheung and Jim, 2017; Liu et al., 2020). Therefore, this study suggests a basic framework for outdoor human thermal perception assessment. The framework comprises of four steps (Fig. 7 ): 4.2.1 Step one – experimental objectives The first step is to define the experimental objectives and accordingly to select the study location, season, time duration as well as the investigated population. The location includes geographic region, climatic zone and site selection. The sites should represent the investigated unit and therefore should include components like hot spots (squares, main streets) and cold spots (parks, water bodies). The study should include at least typical summer and winter conditions and cover both hot and cold hours of the day, unless the research objectives focus on extreme weather events (hot spells, frost, etc). It is recommended that the time duration cover day hours including exposure to direct sun radiation as well the coolest nighttime conditions. Since one of the objectives is the investigated population, it is important to define subjects' personal details (gender, age), activity (metabolism), clothing rate and the thermal history of the respondents. 4.2.2 Step two – field measurements procedure The second step is the field measurement set-up, including monitoring and data collection methods and tools, questionnaire design, sampling methods, Tmrt and index calculation methods. Therefore, it is essential that the field measurements use uniform verified monitoring methods and measurement tools (according to WMO and ASHRAE Standard 55, 1992). Tools and measurements devices should be calibrated before and after the measurement campaigns. This is highly important when comparing in-situ data collected by the researcher to data collected by official meteorological stations. In view of the emerging trend of high-density “lo-fi” sensor networks and wearable sensors of low-cost IoT technologies, future field surveys should include a larger sample size and more observation points in order to overcome the inaccuracy of the new developed sensors. As mentioned in Sections 3.1.1 and 4.1, the questionnaire TSV scale is one of the fundamentals in modifying thermal outdoor indices. Since the basic ASHRAE 7- point scale predict mean vote designed for indoor studies and does not match the commonly used outdoor thermal indices scales it is critically important that the questionnaire TSV scale fit all stress categories of the applied index. Sampling size should be large enough in order to achieve reliable representation of the investigated population. Previous studies that discussed the total sample size, related it to the respondents' number throughout the duration of the study (Cochran, 2007; Johansson et al., 2014; Kohler and Philipp (2020). The present study suggests that sampling size should be related to each 1 °C binned temperature within the measured temperature range. Inconsistency of votes can create bias. So, when standard deviation (SD) is large, a minimum of 20 respondents is required for each 1 °C binned temperature. Therefore, a convenient sampling group is recommended, especially in cases when passerby respondents are not available (e.g. late night to early morning hours). 4.2.3 Third step – statistical data analysis The third step is data analysis, including data quality control, assessment of thermal perception and defining the thermal comfort benchmark. Data quality control is required when sorting the questionnaire answers. The TSV responses should be examined carefully since misunderstandings between interviewer and interviewee or scribal error could create bias. Therefore, illogical votes should be extracted. Finally, at this stage, the researchers should define the required benchmark as follows: “Neutral temperature”: The first method to determine outdoor neutral temperature was suggested by Spagnolo and de Dear (2003a) using probit analysis as the point at which 50% of the sample voted “cooler than neutral” and 50% voted “warmer than neutral”. The most common method to determine outdoor neutral temperature is by linear regression between MTSV and the calculated index values. The neutral temperature is when MTSV = 0 as suggested by Hwang and Lin (2007). If summer and winter neutral temperatures are modified separately, the trend-line may not cross the line of MTSV = 0, hence the neutral temperature cannot be obtained. This can be a result of collecting data during only hot hours of the day. Therefore, it is advisable (a) to collect data from a variety of temperature ranges covering day and nighttime, and (b) to consolidate summer and winter data in order to produce an annual range. When consolidating summer and winter data, a bias may occur for two main reasons: an unequal vote in the two seasons and seasonal adaptation. In order to produce an annual range and overcome these biases, it is suggested that the MTSV of each binned 1 °C overlap of temperature be calculated separately for summer and winter and then to average the two values. “Neutral sensation range” (“neutral range” for PET, “no thermal stress” for UTCI or “comfortable” for SET*/OUTSET*): Ballantyne et al. (1977) suggested determining the neutral sensation range by probit analysis as the range between two transition temperatures; from ‘slightly cool’ to ‘neutral’ (T0) and from ‘neutral’ to ‘slightly warm’ (T1). This method has been applied by a limited number of studies and does not always show a good correlation with the outdoor thermal conditions. A common method to determine neutral sensation range is the thermal acceptability assuming that the thermal acceptable range is considered the neutral sensation range. This assumption is doubtful (Cheung and Jim, 2017), so this method should be applied carefully. Determining neutral sensation range can be achieved by other calibration methods such as discriminant analysis or ordinal logistics. The most common method to determine neutral sensation range is by linear regression corresponding between −0.5 and +0.5 MTSV, which shows the best correlation to the outdoor thermal environment (see Section 3.1.1). Despite its limitations, this study suggests applying the linear regression to determine outdoor neutral temperature in future research. 4.2.4 Fourth step - Modifying index scale to local climate conditions The final step is to modify the original index scale to the local climatic conditions. Prior to the modification, it is required to assemble all of the raw data from each field survey into a consolidated database. Then, using filtering methods, quality control of each value is needed. Once complete, the database can be subjected to a consistent suite of analyses (meta-analyses) and index calculations. In this stage, consistency of analyses across the entire database is critical. The most common method for index modification is the thermal acceptability which enables grading all categories. The “neutral” or “no thermal stress” range is modified firstly as a percentage of unacceptability (80, 85, 88 or 90%). Then the widths of the remaining categories are extrapolated either by temperature intervals (3,4,5 or 8 °C) or by different increment percentages of unacceptability (e.g. 30, 60, 90% or 30, 50, 70, 90% etc.). The use of this method relies on the researcher's experience and interpretation and as a result varies from case to case and should be applied carefully. Hence, it is suggested that statistical analysis be applied for all scale categories modification rather than increments of equal range of thresholds. Studies which applied linear regression and discriminant analysis methods succeeded in modifying all scale categories by systematic and objective statistics criteria (Tables 7 and 8), therefore, these two methods are recommended. 5 Conclusions A comprehensive literature review was carried out for the years 2001–2021. It identified 194 peer-reviewed studies which combined in-situ micrometeorological measurements versus subjective thermal perception applying different indices. It was found that the number of case studies that have succeeded to determine thermal comfort range and complete full scale modification by the same method is too small for a meaningful comparison. This is as a result of the absence of an agreed protocol for outdoor human thermal assessment. Further research is therefore required in order to make a meaningful comparison of thermal adaptation to varied climatic zones and weather conditions. Conducting bio-meteorological research requires special attention to measurement procedure (site, season, time and duration), appropriate questionnaire design, accurate Ta and wind measurements and Tmrt calculations, careful data control and suitable methods to enable entier scale modification. The current study suggests a framework and recommended protocol for outdoor bio-meteorological research in order to refine the outcomes of studies and expand the database with a common denominator. In order to have a better understanding of human thermal adaptation in different climate zones, this study proposes the following: (1) A re-examination of the outcomes of the data-set of past studies using methods recommended above for benchmark determination and for entier scale re-modification. (2) Future studies should be carried out according to the suggested framework and protocol included in the above four steps up to complete modification (Fig. 7). (3) A comparison of the outcomes of studies according to unified criteria of questionnaire point scale, modification methods, and urban tissue type. (4) Finally, in order to apply thermal acceptability as a worldwide modification method, further research should be dedicated to finding agreed percentages of thermal acceptability and increments to determine complete scale thresholds.
